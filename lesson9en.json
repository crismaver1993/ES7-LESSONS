However, in the Bible we often find that questions are used to bring people to a clearer understanding of God.

Jesus was particularly focused on this type of education with His disciples and followers.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;If the church is to be a place of education, it must provide the space for genuine dialogue to occur.

Certainly they had much darkness to fear.</p> <p>They lived under Roman occupation, in a militarized society that despite their lack of telephones and computers and the World Wide Web, in many ways was as efficient as our own, and in some ways even more terrifying.</p> <p>The Romans were everywhere, reminding the masses on the hillside that those who insisted on making trouble quickly would find their way to the torturers&mdash;and to a naked death on a Roman cross. And yet, here was Jesus, calling them to live as light. To be merciful. To be pure in heart.</p> <p>To be makers of peace. Christian education must, then, include teaching our students to be lights in the world, to be able to make choices and decisions that will reveal the reality and goodness of God to others.</p> <p><strong> What are ways that we can, indeed, point others to the reality and goodness of God?</strong></p>"

Forgiveness, grace, and love walked hand in hand with loneliness, commitment, and hardship. If there was a lesson to be learned, it was the lesson that discipleship is not something one takes lightly.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You are a disciple for life&mdash;not just for one day. &ldquo;The Saviour&rsquo;s commission to the disciples . . . includes all believers to the end of time. . . . All to whom the heavenly inspiration has come are put in trust with the gospel</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">. All who receive the life of Christ are ordained to work for the salvation of their fellow men. For this work the church was established, and all who take upon themselves its sacred vows are thereby pledged to be co-workers with Christ.&rdquo;&mdash;Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 822.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As disciples of Jesus, we today must make certain that Jesus is always the center of both our fellowship and our worship. It is good to remember that it was Jesus who invented discipleship. Though the rabbis of His day attracted followers, it was Jesus who called men and women to follow Him.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rabbis could never have imagined a call so radical as to suggest that being with Jesus was more important than all of their commandments. And, as disciples of Jesus, we not only have respect for all people, but will work to provide the kind of place where all people can grow and develop. Hence, all Christian education must include this sense of mission, of purpose, not just to earn a living but to do in our own sphere what Jesus calls us to do: to follow in His footsteps of ministering to those in need, and to share with them the good news of the gospel.</p>"

Some translate the Hebrew word &lsquo;olam as &ldquo;eternity&rdquo; and others as a &ldquo;sense of the past and the future.&rdquo;</p> <p>So then, according to this verse, God has placed in the human heart and mind a sense of the past and the future, eternity itself. That is, as human beings, we are able to think about what has been called &ldquo;the big questions&rdquo; about life and our existence in general.</p> <p>And, of course, here is where Scripture plays the central role. Who are we? Why are we here? How should we live? What happens when we die? Why is there evil and suffering? These are the questions that seekers of truth have been asking since the beginning of recorded history. What a privilege, and what a responsibility, to be able to help point these seekers toward some answers now. What is Christian education if not pointing people to these answers, as found in the Word of God?</p> <p><strong>Why must the Scriptures play the major role in answering the big questions in life?</strong></p>"

As Matthew 18:20 reminds us: &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.&rdquo;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The New Testament vision of what church and community is took shape primarily in the homes of believers. It was here that the community met in small groups, praying, singing, celebrating the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, learning and sharing Jesus&rsquo; words with each other. These worshiping groups also became the first church schools, as this was the place in which new members were introduced to the Bible and to this new life that was found in Jesus.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Paul&rsquo;s writings, such as Romans 12:2, &ldquo;Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind&rdquo; (NIV), suggests that the church took this work of education most seriously. These early believers soon discovered that it is in community that the gospel can best be lived out. In community, we have reason to sing louder, to pray more fervently, and to be more caring and compassionate. When we hear others speak of God&rsquo;s goodness, we sense how good He has been to us; when we hear of one another&rsquo;s struggles and hurts, we sense God&rsquo;s healing in our own lives, and we experience a renewed desire to be instruments of His grace and healing. In today&rsquo;s passage, Paul is asserting that the gospel of God is everything: the power of the Cross, the resurrection of the Lord, the promise of His return</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">. There was simply no better news in all of the world, and Paul spent his life abandoned to the challenge of first and foremost sharing the story of Jesus with the greatest integrity and commitment. Yet, here Paul suggests that the message of the gospel can best be understood, can best be experienced, through the act of sharing life together. We must never forget that people are closely watching to see if our lives illustrate the message of grace that is found in the Bible.</p> <p><strong>Think hard about how you live, and ask yourself:</strong> <strong>What kind of witness am I to those around me?</strong></p>"

In the Sermon on the Mount He sought to undo the work that had been wrought by false education, and to give His hearers a right conception of His kingdom and of His own character. Yet He did not make a direct attack on the errors of the people. He saw the misery of the world on account of sin, yet He did not present before them a vivid delineation of their wretchedness.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He taught them of something infinitely better than they had known. Without combating their ideas of the kingdom of God, He told them the conditions of entrance therein, leaving them to draw their own conclusions as to its nature. The truths He taught are no less important to us than to the multitude that followed Him. We no less than they need to learn the foundation principles of the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&mdash;Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 299.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong> Discussion Questions:</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1</strong> Robert Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1850. Stevenson recounts how one night, as his nanny was getting him ready for bed, he slipped over to the window and saw a captivating sight. It was a lamplighter, going from one gas lamp to the next. With childish delight, he called his nanny over to him and said, &ldquo;Look at that man! He&rsquo;s punching holes in the darkness!&rdquo; What role has God given you in bringing light and love to your community? If you are not sure, invite several church members to sit with you and discuss what you might accomplish together.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2</strong> If the church is to partner with God in reaching out to the world, we must embrace Jesus&rsquo; words and ministry. The very reality of the Incarnation&mdash;of God coming to us, to live in our world, to struggle and to laugh and to cry with us&mdash;reminds us that we are called to care for those around us. How will you do this? How might you employ the young people in your congregation to help with this work?</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3</strong> Think about the responsibility that we as Seventh-day Adventists have to teach others the wonderful truths that we have been given. How can and should the local church play a key role in teaching these truths to others? At the same time, how can the church be a safe place to discuss these truths with those who are asking hard questions about them? What can you do to create an environment in which serious questions can be addressed?</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4</strong> In class, talk about the cultural biases of the society where you live. What are ways your church can teach others to rise above those biases and follow, instead, the teachings of the Scriptures?</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Story inside</strong></p> <p><strong> Internship Crisis in France</strong></p> <p>By Andrew McChesney</p> <p>Elisabeth Birba was dismissed without explanation only a week into an eight-week hospital internship in France.</p> <p>She was devastated. She needed the internship to pass second-year exams. If she failed, she would lose her stipend for food and housing. Her family lived far away in the West Indies. Elisabeth fell to the ground and wept.</p> <p>As she cried, she felt impressed to call a friend. Three times she sensed that God was telling her to make the call. Finally she called. &ldquo;I lost my internship,&rdquo; she said. The friend was surprised. &ldquo;Do you believe in God?&rdquo; she asked. When Elisabeth confirmed that she did, the friend gave her the phone number for another hospital.</p> <p>&ldquo;Call this number if you believe in God,&rdquo; she said. Elisabeth knew it would be difficult to obtain a second internship on such short notice. She wondered what to do. Then she remembered that she had an emergency phone number. Before leaving for France, she had received the number from a Seventh-day Adventist woman in the West Indies. &ldquo;If you ever have trouble in France, call my sister Vivian,&rdquo; the woman said. Elisabeth had accepted the emergency number out of politeness. But now she was so distressed that she called Vivian and told her about the internship. &ldquo;Only God can help you,&rdquo; Vivian said.</p> <p>&ldquo;The only thing we can do is pray.&rdquo; She asked whether Elisabeth had a Bible. It was covered with dust, but she had one. &ldquo;You are going to memorize Psalm 91,&rdquo; Vivian said. &ldquo;Make that psalm yours. When you repeat it, remember it is about you.&rdquo; Elisabeth wept as she read Psalm 91. Her tears left wrinkles on the page. Then she called the hospital to inquire about a last-minute internship. &ldquo;Call back in three days for our decision,&rdquo; a woman told her. She prayed and fasted for three days. She cried. She memorized Psalm 91. On the third day, the woman offered Elisabeth an internship. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>&ldquo;The boss didn&rsquo;t want you but changed his mind at the last minute.&rdquo; Emotion overwhelmed Elisabeth. That night she could not sleep. She realized that God had given her the internship. At 4:00 a.m. she called Vivian. &ldquo;Is something wrong?&rdquo; Vivian asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Elisabeth said. &ldquo;Please take me to the Adventist church.&rdquo; Elisabeth went on to be baptized and to receive a master&rsquo;s degree in France. &ldquo;If I had not surrendered to God the day that I called the emergency number, my education would have ended,&rdquo; said Elisabeth, 27. &ldquo;God can do anything. With Jesus I have succeeded.&rdquo;</p>"
