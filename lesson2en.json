Scientists have now established that animals are able to detect the first of an earthquake&rsquo;s seismic waves&mdash;the pressure wave&mdash;that arrives in advance of the secondary shaking wave. This probably explains why animals have been reported as acting confused, or restless, right before the ground starts to shake. Some animals, such as elephants, can perceive low-frequency sound waves and vibrations from foreshocks, which humans can&rsquo;t detect at all.&nbsp;</p> <p>A few minutes before the 5.8-magnitude quake that hit the Washington, D.C., area on August 23, 2011, some of the animals at the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s National Zoo started behaving strangely. Among those were the lemurs, who began calling loudly for about 15 minutes before the ground started shaking. In this week&rsquo;s study, we look at some examples of strange human restlessness that was brought about, not by impending natural disasters such as earthquakes, but, rather, by the basic sinfulness of fallen human beings who were not resting in what Christ offers all who come to Him in faith and obedience.</p>"

Even Moses was affected. Trying to lead a group of restless people is not easy. But Moses knew whom to turn to. &ldquo; &lsquo;Why have You afflicted Your servant?

In Israel&rsquo;s case, He gave them quail to satisfy their hunger for meat. But it wasn&rsquo;t really the meat Israel wanted. When we are unhappy and restless and angry, what we are angry about is often just the detonator&mdash;not the cause of the conflict. We fight because there is something deeper amiss, affecting our underlying relationships. Israel rebelled against God&rsquo;s leading, something that we all have to be careful about, no matter our immediate situation and context, for it&rsquo;s easier to do than we think.<br><br><strong>Why is it so easy to remember the past as better than it really was?</strong></p>"

Zipporah was an outsider hailing from Midian (see Exod. 3:1). Even among Israel&rsquo;s &ldquo;elite,&rdquo; the fallenness of their nature was revealed, and not in a very pleasant way, either. (Is it ever?)<br><br>The biblical text, however, clearly shows this to be a pretext. The main focus of their complaint is about the prophetic gift. In the previous chapter God had told Moses to appoint 70 of Israel&rsquo;s elders who would help Moses carry the administrative burden of leadership (Num. 11:16, 17, 24, 25). Aaron and Miriam had been playing key leadership roles, as well (Exod. 4:13&ndash;15, Micah 6:4), but now they felt threatened by the new leadership development and said, &ldquo; &lsquo;Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us also?&rsquo; &rdquo; (Num. 12:2, NKJV).<br><br><strong>How does God respond to this complaint? Read Numbers 12:4&ndash;13.

The prophetic gift is not a weapon to be used to wield more power. Moses was well suited for leadership because he had learned how extremely dependent he was on God.<br><br>The fact that Miriam is mentioned before Aaron in Numbers 12:1 suggests she may have been the instigator of the attack on Moses. At this time, Aaron was serving as Israel&rsquo;s high priest. If he had been struck with leprosy, he would not have been able to enter the tabernacle and minister on the people&rsquo;s behalf. God&rsquo;s punishment of Miriam with temporary leprosy communicates vividly His displeasure with both of them and helps bring about the attitude change that this family needs. Aaron&rsquo;s plea for her affirms that he, too, was involved (Num. 12:11), and now instead of criticism and restlessness, we see Aaron pleading for Miriam, and we see Moses interceding on her behalf (Num. 12:11&ndash;13). This is the attitude that God wants to see in His people. He hears, and He heals Miriam.</p> <p><br><br><strong>Though it&rsquo;s always easy to be critical of church leadership at any level, how much better would our church and our own spiritual life be if, instead of complaining, we would intercede in behalf of our leaders, even when we disagree with them?</strong></p>"

Scientists tell us that there is a direct line of cause and effect between too little rest (including lack of sleep) and bad choices, resulting in obesity, addictions, and more restlessness and unhappiness.</p> <p><br><br><strong>Read Numbers 14:1&ndash;10.

Caleb&rsquo;s desperate plea, &ldquo; &lsquo;only do not rebel against the Lord&rsquo; &rdquo; (Num. 14:9, NKJV), goes unheeded, and the entire assembly prepares to stone their leaders. Restlessness leads to rebellion, and rebellion ultimately leads to death.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>&ldquo;The unfaithful spies were loud in denunciation of Caleb and Joshua, and the cry was raised to stone them. The insane mob seized missiles with which to slay those faithful men. They rushed forward with yells of madness, when suddenly the stones dropped from their hands, a hush fell upon them, and they shook with fear. God had interposed to check their murderous design. The glory of His presence, like a flaming light, illuminated the tabernacle. All the people beheld the signal of the Lord. A mightier one than they had revealed Himself, and none dared continue their resistance. The spies who brought the evil report crouched terror-stricken, and with bated breath sought their tents.&rdquo;&mdash;Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 390.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Right then, however, the glory of the Lord manifested itself publicly. When we read the story in Numbers 14, it seems as if the entire scene has been frozen, and we are now privy to listen in on God&rsquo;s conversation with Moses. God recognizes that even though the stones are meant for Moses and Caleb and Joshua, ultimately the rebellion is directed against God Himself.</p>"

Moses&rsquo; answer, frozen into time, anticipates the Intercessor who, more than 1,400 years later, would pray for His disciples in their afflictions (John 17). Indeed, in what Moses did here, many theologians and Bible students have seen an example of what Christ does for us. Their guilt, our guilt, is not even questioned. And yet, Moses pleads, saying, &ldquo; &lsquo;according to the greatness of Your mercy&rsquo; &rdquo; (Num. 14:19, NKJV), please forgive these people. And just as the Lord did then because of Moses&rsquo; intercession, thus He does for us because of Jesus, because of His death and resurrection and intercession for us.<br><br>Thus, Moses pleads: &ldquo; &lsquo;Pardon the iniquity of this people, I pray, accord- ing to the greatness of Your mercy, just as You have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now&rsquo; &rdquo; (Num. 14:19, NKJV). Grace combats rebellion and restlessness at its core. Forgiveness offers new beginnings. Yet, there are costs. Grace can never be cheap. Though forgiven, the people will face the consequences of their rebellions, and that genera tion will not enter into the Promised Land (Num. 14:20&ndash;23).<br><br>Yes, God will sustain them for another 38 years in the wilderness. He will feed them. He will speak to them from the sanctuary. He will be at their side in the wilderness. But then they will die, and a new genera tion will have to pick up the baton and find rest in the Promised Land.<br><br>It sounded like judgment; yet, it really was grace. How would this generation be able to conquer Canaan&rsquo;s powerful city-states if they had not yet learned to trust Him? How would they be a light to the nations when they themselves were stumbling in the darkness?<br><br><strong>What hard lessons have you learned about the consequences of forgiven sin?</strong></p>"
