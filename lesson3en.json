      "lessonText": "<p>One Sabbath Connie and Roy drove into their driveway after church. A bantam hen flew frantically across the yard in front of them. Something was wrong. The pet birds were supposed to be safely in their pen but had gotten out. Quick investigation showed a tragedy in progress. Beethoven, the neighbor&rsquo;s small dog, also had escaped her yard and was down by the pond with Daisy in her mouth. Daisy was a beautiful laying hen with fluffy white tail feathers. Connie rescued Daisy, but it was too late. Her precious pet, now with a mangled neck, soon died in Connie&rsquo;s arms. She sat down in the yard, holding the dead bird, and wailed.</p> <p>Another pet was deeply disturbed. A tall, white duck by the name of Waddlesworth saw Connie holding Daisy and seemed to have assumed she had killed her. So, for the next few weeks, whenever Waddlesworth saw Connie, he would viciously attack her, pinching her painfully with his strong bill. Sometimes it is hard to sort out who your friends and enemies are.</p> <p>This week we&rsquo;ll look at a king of Judah who also had this problem, and we&rsquo;ll seek to understand why he made the wrong choices he did.</p>"

This happened when Judah was weakened by attacks from the Edomites and Philistines. In the past, Judah had fought against Israel, but an alliance between Israel and Syria presented an overwhelming peril. It appears Israel and Syria wanted to force Judah to participate with them in a coalition against the mighty power of Tiglath-pileser III of Assyria (called &ldquo;Pul&rdquo; in 2 Kings 15:19), who continued to threaten them with his expanding empire. Israel and Syria had put aside their longstanding struggle against each other in view of a greater danger. If they could conquer Judah and install a puppet ruler there (Isa. 7:5, 6), they could use its resources and manpower.</p> <p><strong>What was Ahaz&rsquo;s solution when his world was falling apart?

The Assyrian king happily complied with his request for aid against Syria and Israel. Not only did Tiglath-pileser receive a rich bribe from Ahaz, but he also gained a good excuse to take Syria, which he promptly did (2 Kings 16:9). The power of the Syrian-Israelite alliance was broken. In the short run, it appeared that Ahaz had saved Judah.</p> <p>This action on Ahaz&rsquo;s part, however, should not come as a surprise. He had been one of the worst kings ever to rule Judah up to that point. (See 2 Kings 16:3, 4; 2 Chron. 28:2&ndash;4.)</p> <p><strong>When we read about what Ahaz was like, it is understandable why he reacted to danger as he did.

      "lessonText": "<p>While Ahaz was weighing his political options to meet the threat from Israel and Syria, God knew some things he did not. For one thing, it was God who had allowed trouble to come upon him in order to discipline him and bring him to his senses (2 Chron. 28:5, 19). Moreover, although appealing to Tiglath-pileser for help seemed logical and attractive from a human standpoint, God knew it would bring the Davidic kingdom of Judah under foreign control from which she could never recover.</p> <p>The stakes were staggeringly high. So, the Lord sent Isaiah to intercept the king (apparently as he was inspecting Jerusalem&rsquo;s water supply in preparation for a siege) in order to persuade him not to contact the Assyrian leader.</p> <p><strong>Why did the Lord tell Isaiah to take his son, Shear-jashub, with him?

Shall return from what? Because the boy&rsquo;s father was a prophet, the name sounded like an ominous message from God about people going into captivity. Or was it about returning to God in the sense of repenting (the verb &ldquo;return&rdquo; also carries the meaning of repentance)? The message from God to Ahaz was: it means what you make it mean! Turn from your sins or go into captivity, and from captivity a remnant will return. The decision is yours!</p> <p><strong>How did God&rsquo;s message address the king&rsquo;s situation?

Powers that looked to Ahaz like huge, fiery volcanoes were in God&rsquo;s sight only &ldquo;two smoldering stumps of firebrands&rdquo; (Isa. 7:4, NRSV). There was no need for Ahaz to appeal to Assyria for help.</p> <p>But in order to make the right decision, Ahaz needed to trust the Lord and His promises. He needed to believe in order to be established (Isa. 7:9). The words for &ldquo;believe&rdquo; and &ldquo;be established&rdquo; are from the same Hebrew root, from which come also the word for &ldquo;truth&rdquo; (that which is reliable) and the word amen (affirming that which is true/reliable). Ahaz needed to be sure in order to be made sure; he needed to rely in order to be reliable.</p> <p><strong>Look at that last section of Isaiah 7:9. Why are faith and belief so important in order to be &ldquo;established&rdquo;? Established in what? How does this principle apply in the life of the Christian?</strong></p>"

      "lessonText": "<p>Ahaz did not respond to Isaiah&rsquo;s call for faith. So, God mercifully gave the king another chance, telling him to ask for a sign that was &ldquo;deep as Sheol or high as heaven&rdquo; (Isa. 7:11, NRSV). Here is one of the greatest invitations to faith ever given to a human being. Unlike lotteries or sweepstakes, God placed no restrictions in fine print. God did not even limit His offer to the half of His kingdom, as human rulers did when they reached the upper limit of their generosity (see Esther 5:6, Esther 7:2, Mark 6:23). He was ready and willing to empty all of heaven and earth for a wicked king if he would only believe! As a sign, Ahaz could have asked for a mountain of gold or soldiers as numerous as grains of sand by the Mediterranean.</p> <p><strong>Why did Ahaz respond in the way he did?

He would not put God to the test, as the Israelites had centuries before, during their wilderness wanderings (Exod. 17:2, Deut. 6:16). But the difference was that God invited the king to put Him to the test (compare Mal. 3:10). To take Him up on His overwhelmingly generous gift would please Him, not test His patience. But Ahaz was not even willing to allow God to help him to believe. He barred and bolted the door of his heart to shut out faith.</p> <p><strong>Read Isaiah 7:13.

But the most troubling aspect of this verse is the fact that here Isaiah refers to &ldquo;my God,&rdquo; by clear contrast to Isaiah 7:11, where the prophet asked the king to ask a sign of the Lord &ldquo;your God.&rdquo; When Ahaz refused the divine offer, he rejected the Lord from being his God. The Lord was the God of Isaiah&mdash;but not of Ahaz.</p> <p><strong>What does this day&rsquo;s study teach us about God&rsquo;s forbearance and willingness to bring all of us to salvation?

So, when God says He Himself will come up with a sign (Isa. 7:14), we expect it to have breathtaking dimensions that only the divine imagination could devise (compare Isa. 55:9, 1 Cor. 2:9).</p> <p>Surprise! The sign is a son. But how could a young woman bearing a child and calling him &ldquo;Immanuel&rdquo; be a sign of biblical proportions?</p> <p><strong>Who is the woman, and who is her Child?</strong></p> <p>Nowhere does the Old Testament point out a fulfillment of this important sign, as it had done for the signs given to other people, such as Gideon (Judg. 6:36&ndash;40). So, here are some of the possible fulfillments, based on the Old Testament alone:</p> <p>1. Because the word for &ldquo;young woman&rdquo; refers to a young woman of marriageable age, many assume she is a married woman living in Jerusalem, perhaps the wife of Isaiah. Isaiah 8:3 does record the birth of a son to Isaiah by &ldquo;the prophetess&rdquo; (referring to his wife, whose prophetic messages consisted, at least, of her children; compare Isa. 7:3, Isa. 8:18). However, this son was named Maher-shalal-hash-baz (Isa. 8:1&ndash;4), not Immanuel. Nevertheless, the signs of the two boys are similar in that before they reach the stage at which they can choose good or evil, Syria and northern Israel would be devastated (Isa. 7:16, Isa. 8:4).</p> <p>2. Some suggest that Immanuel is Hezekiah, son of Ahaz, who became the next king. But nowhere is the name Immanuel applied to him.</p> <p>3. Because Immanuel is somewhat mysterious and His name, commonly translated &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; refers to God&rsquo;s presence, He could be the same as the special Son prophesied in Isaiah 9 and 11. If so, His exalted description as divine (Isa. 9:6) and &ldquo;the root of Jesse&rdquo; (Isa. 11:10, NRSV) surpasses anything that could be ascribed to good King Hezekiah.</p> <p>4. A natural birth to an unmarried woman of marriageable age would result in an illegitimate child through illegal promiscuity (see Deut. 22:20, 21). Why would God refer to such a child as a sign to inspire faith?</p> <p>In contrast, the New Testament identifies Jesus as Immanuel (Matt. 1:21&ndash;23), born miraculously and with purity to an unmarried but betrothed virgin. Jesus also is the divine Son (Isa. 9:6, Matt. 3:17) and the &ldquo;shoot&rdquo; and &ldquo;root&rdquo; of Jesse (Isa. 11:1, 10; Rev. 22:16). Perhaps an earlier &ldquo;Immanuel,&rdquo; whose development proved to Ahaz the timeliness of prophetic fulfillments, served as a forerunner of Christ. We do not know. But we know what we need to know: &ldquo;when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman&rdquo; (Gal. 4:4, NRSV), to give us the presence of God with us.</p> <p><strong>Dwell on the reality of Christ&rsquo;s coming into humanity. What kind of comfort can this reality give us amid what seems like a cold, fearsome, and uncaring world?</strong></p>"

It is literally &ldquo;with us God.&rdquo; But the commonly accepted translation &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; misses something important. As with other Hebrew names of this kind that lack verbs, the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; must be supplied, because it is not expressed in Hebrew. So, Immanuel must be translated &ldquo;God is with us&rdquo; (compare the same words in Isa. 8:10), just as the name &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; (Greek, and short for Hebrew Yehoshua, or Joshua) means &ldquo;The Lord is salvation,&rdquo; with the verb again being supplied (compare Isaiah, which means, &ldquo;salvation of the Lord&rdquo;).</p> <p>But the name &ldquo;Immanuel&rdquo; is not just an abstract description; it is an assertion of a promise that is fulfilled now: &ldquo;God is with us&rdquo;!</p> <p><strong>What is the significance of the promise that God is with us?</strong></p> <p>There is no stronger assurance and comfort.

But when Jesus ascended to heaven, He &lsquo;sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high&rsquo; (Heb. 1:3). Why did He stand when Stephen was in trouble, about to be stoned to death? As Morris Venden has said, &lsquo;Jesus wasn&rsquo;t going to take that sitting down!&rsquo; &rdquo;&mdash;Roy Gane, God&rsquo;s Faulty Heroes (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald Pub. Assn., 1996), p. 66.</p> <p><strong>Even though we have the promise that &ldquo;God is with us,&rdquo; what difference does that make if we still face terrible trials and suffering?

White, Prophets and Kings, p. 329.</p> <p><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> When you are in the process of making a decision, is it appropriate to ask God for a sign? What dangers are possibly inherent in doing something like that?</p> <p><strong>2</strong> It is good to have human assistance, but how do you recognize its limits?</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Russian author Leo Tolstoy wrote to a friend that &ldquo;once a man has realized that death is the end of everything, then there is nothing worse than life either.&rdquo; How does our knowledge that &ldquo;God is with us&rdquo; answer such a statement?</p> <p><strong>Summary:</strong> God brought faithless King Ahaz to circumstances in which he had to make a difficult decision: To believe or not to believe, this is the question. Even though the Lord offered him any sign that his imagination could devise, he refused to allow God to demonstrate a reason why he should believe. Instead, he chose as his &ldquo;friend&rdquo; the king of Assyria.</p> <p><strong>Inside Story</strong></p> <p><strong>Floating Red Book</strong></p> <p>By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission</p> <p>Toroni Kumar Tripura was thrilled to receive a Bible with a beautiful red cover in his remote village in southeast Bangladesh. The Bible arrived as a reward for completing a series of Bible lessons by mail.</p> <p>But Toroni had to be careful.</p> <p>His father served as a priest in the family&rsquo;s traditional religion, and he would not be pleased that his son had a Bible about the God of heaven.</p> <p>Toroni, however, wasn&rsquo;t worried. He had studied the Bible lessons every night while his parents slept, and he also intended to read the red Bible at night.</p> <p>The plan seemed to work.</p> <p>Toroni tended Father&rsquo;s cows during the day and, after returning home at night, waited until his parents were asleep to eagerly switch on a tiny flashlight and read about God.</p> <p>One night Father caught Toroni reading the Bible. He was furious. After his son left the house the next day, he seized the red Bible and threw it into the muddy waters of the Chenggi River.</p> <p>Toroni was distraught when he realized that his red Bible was missing. He quickly understood what had happened.</p> <p>What could he do? He couldn&rsquo;t afford to buy another Bible. The correspondence school probably wouldn&rsquo;t send him a second Bible. But he longed to read more about God.</p> <p>Some time passed. One afternoon Toroni was swimming in the Chenggi River when he saw something floating on the water. He had seen plastic bottles and other garbage in the river, but this looked different.</p> <p>He swam closer.</p> <p>Reaching out, he grabbed the object with his hand and hastily swam to shore. Climbing onto the riverbank, he raised his hand to see a dripping red Bible.</p> <p>He couldn&rsquo;t believe it. It was his missing Bible.</p> <p>Toroni placed the book on the grass in the hot sun to dry. It took 14 days to dry the Bible, and then he began to read it again. As he read, he fell in love with God.</p> <p>Even though he risked angering his father, he couldn&rsquo;t keep the newfound love to himself. He told other villagers about the God of the red Bible that wouldn&rsquo;t sink in the river. The astounded villagers asked to know more. Today most of the villagers, including many of Toroni&rsquo;s relatives, worship the God of the red Bible.</p>"
