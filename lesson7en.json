If the glass was full, it was shared by two of the children, and whoever drank first had to be careful not to drink too far.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After the little fellow was made comfortable in the hospital, the nurse brought him a large glass of milk. He looked at it longingly for a moment and then, with the memory of privations at home, asked, &lsquo;How deep shall I drink?&rsquo; The nurse, with her eyes shining and a lump in her throat, said, &lsquo;Drink it all, child, drink it all!&rsquo; &rdquo;&mdash;H.M.S.

In teaching its young to fly it carried them upon its back to those great heights that overlook the plains of Sinai, then it dropped them down into the depths. If the baby was still too young and too bewildered to fly, father-eagle would swoop down beneath it, catch it on his back, and fly up again with it to the eyrie on the crags above.

      "lessonText": "<p>The book of Exodus draws the reader&rsquo;s attention to three major events. Like three mountains, the Exodus itself, the establishment of the covenant, and the building of the tabernacle sanctuary rise above the foothills of lesser happenings. The establishment of the covenant, recorded in Exodus 19 through 24, was the Mount Everest of the three. A brief outline of Exodus 19 through 24 shows the sequence and the relationship of events.<br><br>Even if you do not have the time to look up all the verses listed below, focus on the sequence of events:<br><br>1. Israel&rsquo;s arrival and encampment at Sinai after being delivered by the Lord (Exod. 19:1, 2)<br><br>2. God&rsquo;s proposal of a covenant with Israel (Exod. 19:3&ndash;6)<br><br>3. Israel&rsquo;s response in acceptance of the covenant (Exod. 19:7, 8)<br><br>4. Preparations for formally receiving the covenant (Exod. 19:9&ndash;25)<br><br>5. Proclamation of the Ten Commandments (Exod. 20:1&ndash;17)<br><br>6. Moses as covenant mediator (Exod. 20:18&ndash;21)<br><br>7. Covenant principles spelled out (Exod. 20:22&ndash;23:22)<br><br>8. Ratification of the covenant (Exod. 24:1&ndash;18)<br><br>This covenant plays a vital role in the plan of salvation. It is the fourth covenant listed in the Bible (preceded by the ones with Adam, Noah, and Abraham), and in it God reveals Himself more fully than before, particularly as the entire sanctuary ritual is established. Thus, the sanctuary becomes the means by which He shows the people the plan of salvation that they were to reveal to the world.<br><br>Though the Lord had redeemed Israel from the bondage of Egypt, He wanted them to understand that redemption had a greater, more significant meaning than merely freedom from physical bondage. He wanted to redeem them from sin, the ultimate slavery, and this could happen only through the sacrifice of the Messiah, as taught in the types and symbols of the sanctuary service. It is no wonder, then, that not long after they were redeemed from bondage and given the law, the Israelites were instructed to build the sanctuary and establish its services, for in these things God revealed to them the plan of redemption&mdash;which is the true meaning and purpose of the covenant. For the covenant is nothing if not a covenant of salvation that the Lord offers to fallen humanity. That is what it was in Eden, and that is what it was at Sinai.<br><br>Why was a covenant between God and the people of Israel a necessity? (See Deut. 29:10&ndash;13; notice, again, the relational aspect of the covenant.)<br><br></p> <p><strong>Deut. 29:10&ndash;13</strong></p> <p><br></p> <p><strong><span class=\"text Deut-29-10\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10&nbsp;</sup></span></strong>All of you stand today before the Lord your God: your leaders and your tribes and your elders and your officers, all the men of Israel, &nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span class=\"text Deut-29-11\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11&nbsp;</sup></span></strong>your little ones and your wives&mdash;also the stranger who is in your camp, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water&mdash; &nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span class=\"text Deut-29-12\"><sup class=\"versenum\">1</sup></span></strong><strong><span class=\"text Deut-29-12\"><sup class=\"versenum\">2</sup></span></strong> that you may enter into covenant with the Lord your God, and into His oath, which the Lord your God makes with you today, &nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span class=\"text Deut-29-13\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13&nbsp;</sup></span></strong>that He may establish you today as a people for Himself, and that He may be God to you, just as He has spoken to you, and just as He has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>"

They could not do it either in Israel&rsquo;s time, and they cannot in our time, as well.</p> <p><strong> If, however, the Bible again and again stresses works, why can&rsquo;t works make us acceptable in God&rsquo;s sight?

They sought righteousness in their obedience to the law, not the righteouness of God, which comes by faith.</p> <p>The Sinai covenant&mdash;though coming with a much more detailed set of instructions and law&mdash;was designed a covenant of grace as much as all the preceding covenants, as well. This grace, freely bestowed, brings about a change of heart that leads to obedience. The problem, of course, was not their attempt to obey (the covenant demanded that they obey); the problem was the kind of &ldquo;obedience&rdquo; they rendered, which wasn&rsquo;t really obedience at all, as the subsequent history of the nation showed.</p> <p><strong> Read carefully Romans 10:3, particularly the last part. What point is Paul making there? What happens to people who seek to establish their own righteousness? Why does that attempt inevitably lead to sin, unrighteousness, and rebellion? Look at our own lives. Are we not in danger of doing the same thing?</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Romans 10:3</strong></p>"

White, The Exodus, pp. 281&ndash;290; From the Red Sea to Sinai, pp. 291&ndash;302; The Law Given to Israel, pp. 303&ndash;314, in Patriarchs and Prophets.</p> <p>The spirit of bondage is engendered by seeking to live in accordance with legal religion, through striving to fulfill the claims of the law in our own strength. There is hope for us only as we come under the Abrahamic covenant, which is the covenant of grace by faith in Christ Jesus.</p> <p>The gospel preached to Abraham, through which he had hope, was the same gospel that is preached to us today, through which we have hope. Abraham looked unto Jesus, who is also the Author and the Finisher of our faith.&mdash;Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1077. During the bondage in Egypt many of the Israelites had, to a great extent, lost the knowledge of God&rsquo;s law, and had mingled its precepts with heathen customs and traditions.</p> <p>God brought them to Sinai, and there with His own voice declared His law.&mdash;Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 334.</p> <p><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong>. In what ways was the covenant relationship designed to maintain Israel&rsquo;s physical and spiritual freedoms? (See Lev. 26:3&ndash;13; compare Deut. 28:1&ndash;15.)</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Read again Exodus 19:5, 6. Notice that the Lord makes this statement: All the earth is mine. Why would He say that, particularly in this context, one of seeking to establish a covenant with these people? How does our understanding of the Sabbath, and what it means, fit in here?</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> We understand that we are forgiven our sins only through God&rsquo;s grace. How do we understand the role of God&rsquo;s grace in enabling us to live a life of faith and obedience?</p> <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The covenant God formed with Israel at Sinai was a covenant of grace. Having given abundant evidence of His gracious love and care by an extraordinary deliverance from Egyptian slavery, God invited the nation into a covenant with Him that would maintain and promote their freedoms.</p> <p>Although Israel responded in the affirmative, they lacked a true faith motivated by love. Their later history indicates that, for the most part, they failed to understand the true nature of the covenant and corrupted it into a salvation-by-works system. We need not follow Israel&rsquo;s failure and ignore the marvelous grace that has been extended to sinners.</p> <p><strong>Inside Story</strong></p> <p><strong>Let&rsquo;s Go to Church!</strong></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission</strong></p> <p>Something curious happened once Dr. Hernando D&iacute;az began working at the Seventh-day Adventist clinic on the campus of Colombia Adventist University in Medellin, Colombia. He couldn&rsquo;t stop praising God. Hernando had long been a Christian, but he had never loved God so much.</p> <p>When no one would hire him as a physician, the Adventist Medical Center offered him a flexible schedule that allowed him to spend as much time as he needed with his critically ill two-year-old son, Samuel. His love for God overflowed.</p> <p>He prayed with every patient who consented. He told everyone who would listen that God had miraculously saved his son&rsquo;s life and marvelously provided him with the job at the clinic. He invited people to the university church, where he and his family regularly worshiped on Sabbath, even though they weren&rsquo;t Adventists. One Sabbath after his baptism, Hernando stopped at a red light as he was driving the family to church.</p> <p>A street vendor approached the car holding packs of chewing gum for sale. The sight was typical in Medellin, but Hernando had an unusual response. When he rolled down the window, the street vendor eagerly came up to him, hoping to make a sale. Hernando didn&rsquo;t mention the chewing gum at all.</p> <p>Let&rsquo;s go to church! he said. The street vendor didn&rsquo;t hesitate. Let&rsquo;s go! he said. Hernando could tell from the street vendor&rsquo;s accent that he was from Venezuela. Thousands of Venezuelans have crossed the border into neighboring Colombia to look for work amid an economic crisis at home. Hernando shared his personal testimony with the street vendor as they traveled to the university church.</p> <p>The next Sabbath, the Venezuelan man returned to church with his own family. He and his family never missed a Sabbath. He now cooks and sells food on the street outside the Adventist Medical Center, using a food cart donated by church members. He and his family are taking baptismal classes. Hernando is praying that the family will give their hearts to Jesus, joining the six other people who have been baptized through his efforts. Hernando said it isn&rsquo;t difficult to lead people to Jesus.</p> <p>He follows the instructions that Jesus gave to the formerly demon-possessed man: Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you (Mark 5:19, NKJV). I haven&rsquo;t stopped glorifying God with my personal testimony, Hernando said. It has touched many hearts.</p>"
