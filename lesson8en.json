There was the punishment administered by Assyria, the rod of God&rsquo;s anger (Isaiah 10), from which God delivered Judah by destroying Sennacherib&rsquo;s army in 701 b.c. (Isaiah 37). There was the punishment administered by Babylon, which would carry away goods and people from Judah because Hezekiah had displayed his wealth to the messengers from Merodach-baladan (Isaiah 39, NRSV). And there was the punishment administered by one of the other nations against which Isaiah wrote messages (Isaiah 14&ndash;23).<br><br>Meanwhile, though &ldquo;Assyria&rdquo; and &ldquo;Assyrian[s]&rdquo; are mentioned 43 times from Isaiah 7:17 to 38:6, this nation appears only once in the rest of Isaiah, where Isaiah 52:4 refers to past oppression by Egypt and then by &ldquo;the Assyrian.&rdquo; In the latter part of Isaiah, deliverance from exile in Babylon is mentioned (Isa. 43:14; Isa. 47:1; Isa. 48:14, 20), and it is Cyrus, the Persian who conquered Babylon in 539 b.c., who is to free the exiles of Judah (Isa. 44:28, Isa. 45:1, Isa. 45:13).<br><br>Isaiah 1&ndash;39 emphasizes events leading up to deliverance from the Assyrians in 701 b.c., but at the beginning of chapter 40, the book leaps ahead a century and a half to the end of Babylon, in 539 b.c., and the return of the Jews shortly thereafter.<br><br><strong>Is the theme of return from Babylon linked with anything earlier in Isaiah? If so, what?</strong><br><br>Isaiah 39 serves as a transition to the following chapters by predicting a Babylonian captivity, at least for some of Hezekiah&rsquo;s descendants (Isa. 39:6, 7). Furthermore, the oracles of Isaiah 13, 14, and 21 predict the fall of Babylon and the liberty this would bring to God&rsquo;s people: &ldquo;But the Lord will have compassion on Jacob and will again choose Israel, and will set them in their own land. . . . When the Lord has given you rest from your pain and turmoil and the hard service with which you were made to serve, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon&rdquo; (Isa. 14:1&ndash;4, NRSV). Notice the close connection with Isaiah 40:1, 2, where God promises His people there is an end to their suffering.<br><br><strong>What do Bible promises about the end of suffering mean to you now, amid your present suffering? What good would our faith be without those promises? Why, then, is it so important to cling to them, no matter what?</strong></p>"

Another voice proclaims that although humans are transient like foliage, &ldquo;the word of our God will stand forever&rdquo; (Isa. 40:8, NRSV). After the exile, God&rsquo;s people gain back what they had received at Mount Sinai and then rejected all throughout their apostasy, for which they were punished: God&rsquo;s presence and His Word. These are the basic ingredients of God&rsquo;s covenant with Israel, which were enshrined at His sanctuary in their midst (Exod. 25:8, 16). Because they had violated His Word, God had abandoned His temple (Ezekiel 9&ndash;11), but He is coming back. His presence and His eternally dependable Word bring comfort, deliverance, and hope.<br><br><strong>What preparation is necessary for the Lord&rsquo;s coming?

So, his coming is preceded by roadwork. The more so for the King of kings! His coming, apparently from the east, where He has been in exile with His people as a sanctuary to them (Ezek. 11:16), would require major rearrangement of the terrain. Construction of a literal, level superhighway through the rugged hills east of Jerusalem would be daunting, even with dynamite and bulldozers. God is the only One who can do the work; it is He who turns &ldquo;the rough places into level ground&rdquo; (Isa. 42:16, NRSV). But He doesn&rsquo;t need a literal road for transportation because He has an airborne chariot of cherubim (Ezekiel 1, 9&ndash;11).&nbsp;</p> <p>The New Testament explicitly applies Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy to the spiritual roadwork accomplished through the preaching of John the Baptist (Matt. 3:3). His message was: &ldquo; &lsquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near&rsquo; &rdquo; (Matt. 3:2, NRSV) and the baptism that he performed was &ldquo;of repentance for the forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Mark 1:4, NRSV). So, the roadwork was repentance, willingness to turn away from sin, in order to receive the comfort of God&rsquo;s forgiveness and presence.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jeremiah 31:31&ndash;34 proclaimed the same spiritual message in plenty of time for the exiles of Judah to understand the spiritual nature of roadwork for God. In this passage, the Lord promises those who are willing a fresh start: a &ldquo;new covenant&rdquo; in which He puts His law in their hearts and pledges to be their God. They know Him and His character, because He has forgiven them.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Read carefully Isaiah 40:6&ndash;8. What hope can you, who fade away as does the grass, derive from what these verses say? In what should they warn us against putting our trust?</strong></p>"

But in Isaiah 40:9 the herald to proclaim &ldquo; &lsquo;Here is your God!&rsquo; &rdquo; (NRSV) from a mountain is female, a fact brought out in the Hebrew.<br><br>In Psalm 68, David praises God because He &ldquo;gives the desolate a home to live in; he leads out the prisoners to prosperity&rdquo; (Ps. 68:6, NRSV). Though here these words apply to the Exodus from Egyptian bondage, Isaiah uses the same ideas with reference to the proclamation of a second &ldquo;Exodus&rdquo;: the return from Babylonian captivity.<br><br>Meanwhile, the New Testament applies Isaiah 40:3&ndash;5 to John the Baptist, who prepared the way for Christ, the eternal Word who became the Lord&rsquo;s presence in flesh among His people (John 1:14).<br><br>Even earlier than John, others spoke about the good news of His coming. Among the first of these were the elderly Simeon and Anna, who met Baby Jesus when He was dedicated at the temple (Luke 2:25&ndash;38). Like Isaiah&rsquo;s heralds, they were male and female. Simeon was looking forward to the consolation/comfort of Israel in the form of the Messiah (Luke 2:25, 26).<br><br>In light of Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy, it does not appear coincidental that Anna, a prophetess, was the very first to announce publicly at the temple mountain to the people of Jerusalem that the Lord had come: &ldquo;At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem&rdquo; (Luke 2:38, NRSV). This was the birth of Christian evangelism as we know it: proclamation of the gospel, the good news, that Jesus Christ has come to bring salvation. Later, Christ entrusted to another woman, Mary Magdalene, the first tidings of His triumphant resurrection (John 20:17, 18), which ensured that His gospel mission to planet Earth was accomplished. Flesh is like grass, but the divine Word who became flesh is eternal (see Isa. 40:6&ndash;8)!<br><br><strong>Look at Isaiah 40:11. What kind of imagery is presented here?

Here Isaiah&rsquo;s style, with rhetorical questions and vivid analogies referring to the earth and its parts, sounds like God&rsquo;s answer to Job (Job 38&ndash;41).<br><br><strong>What is the answer to Isaiah&rsquo;s rhetorical question: &ldquo;To whom then will you liken God?&rdquo; (Isa. 40:18, NRSV.)</strong></p> <p><strong>Isa. 40:18&nbsp;</strong></p> <div class=\"poetry top-1\"> <p class=\"line\"><span class=\"text Isa-40-18\"><sup class=\"versenum\"><strong>18&nbsp;</strong></sup>To whom then will you liken God?</span><br><span class=\"text Isa-40-18\">Or what likeness will you compare to Him?</span><br><br>For Isaiah, as for Job, the answer goes without saying: no one.

Already it looks foolish to use an idol as a likeness of God, but just to be sure people get the point, he elaborates on God&rsquo;s uniqueness and brings in the unanswerable argument that He is the holy Creator (Isa. 40:21&ndash;26).<br><br><strong>How does verse 27 reveal the attitude of the people addressed by Isaiah&rsquo;s message? In what ways are we guilty of having the same attitude?<br></strong><br>The purpose of God&rsquo;s message is to comfort people who need it!

Rather than being discouraged and confused, they could trust God to use His creative power on their behalf.<br><br><strong>Inside Story</strong><br><br><strong>Seven Little Fishers of Men</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission<br><br>What is the power of a small group? The pastor of a Seventh-day Adventist church in northeastern Mexico announced to its 60 members that they should form small groups to meet during the week. Each group should have a name, a motto, a goal, and a theme song. The idea came from the local conference. Several adults immediately formed a small group called Joseph, saying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be like Joseph and have a vision to save others.&rdquo; Other adults established groups called Sowers of Faith, The Rock, Friends of Jesus, and United in Faith. The director of the children&rsquo;s ministries department also wanted to create a group. She gathered the seven children and their parents who regularly worshiped at Nuevo Tampico Seventh-day Adventist Church in Altamira to discuss the idea, and the mother of eight-year-old Manuel offered her house for the weekly meetings. The group adopted the name Fishers of Men. Fifteen children showed up for the first meeting, including eight children from non-Adventist homes who were invited by the children&rsquo;s ministries director, Elsa Galv&aacute;n. The children took turns reading a Bible story. They also sang songs and prayed. At the end of the hourlong gathering, the children drank hot chocolate and ate cookies. The Fishers of Men group began to meet every week. The children also visited a hospital once a month to pray with patients and to distribute the Adventist Church&rsquo;s sharing book of the year. The children gave atole hot drinks to the patients and tortas bread filled with beans and cheese. With a stable group of children attending week after week, the small group decided to form an Adventurer club. Later, the older children in the group created a Pathfinder club. After a while, the children started offering Bible studies to family members, friends, and neighbors. With the help of his mother, Manuel gave Bible studies to his grandfather and aunt. One day, his grandfather and aunt announced that they wanted to go to the hospital with the children. Shortly afterward, they were baptized. Manuel and his mother are now giving Bible studies to an eight-year-old cousin. Many other children also are giving Bible studies, including 12-year-old Victor and his mother, who are studying with an eight-year-old friend and two cousins, ages 7 and 9. In its first year, Fishers of Men led 12 people to baptism, more than half of the 20 people baptized in the church over that period. &ldquo;This says a lot about the power of a small group,&rdquo; said the church&rsquo;s 34-year-old pastor, Samuel Alvarado (pictured with Manuel, left, and Victor). &ldquo;Jesus started His ministry with a small group of twelve disciples and our church is doing the same for the glory of God.&rdquo;</p>"
