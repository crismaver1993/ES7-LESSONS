On this particular morning, business men and women glanced in the window and noticed it was only fifteen minutes to nine; children on their way to school were surprised to find they still had plenty of time to loiter. Many persons were late that morning because one small clock in the jeweler&rsquo;s window had stopped.&rdquo;&mdash;C. L.

The word translated as &ldquo;special&rdquo; in the above verse, segullah, can mean &ldquo;valued property&rdquo; or &ldquo;peculiar treasure.&rdquo; The crucial point to remember, too, is that this choice was totally the act of God, an expression of His grace. There was nothing found in the people themselves that made them deserve this grace. There couldn&rsquo;t be, because grace is something that comes undeserved.<br><br><strong>Read Ezekiel 16:8. How does it help explain the Lord&rsquo;s choosing of Israel?<br></strong><br>Ezekiel 16:8</p> <p>8 Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest mine.<br><br>&ldquo;Why was Israel chosen by Yahweh? That was inscrutable. She was a small group of people without great culture or prestige. She possessed no special personal qualities which would warrant such a choice. The election was the act of God alone. . . . The ultimate cause for that choice lay in the mystery of divine love. Yet the fact is that God did love Israel and did choose her, thereby honouring His promise to the fathers. . . . She had been chosen in virtue of Yahweh&rsquo;s love for her. She had been liberated from slavery in Egypt by a display of Yahweh&rsquo;s power. Let her once grasp these great facts and she would realize that she was indeed a holy and a specially treasured people. Any tendency on her part, therefore, to surrender such a noble status was reprehensible in the extreme.&rdquo;&mdash;J. A. Thompson, Deuteronomy (London: Inter-Varsity Press, 1974), pp. 130, 131.<br><br>According to the divine plan, the Israelites were to be both a royal and a priestly race. In an evil world they were to be kings, moral and spiritual, in that they were to prevail over the realm of sin. As priests, they were to draw near to the Lord in prayer, in praise, and in sacrifice. As intermediaries between God and the heathen, they were to serve as instructors, preachers, and prophets and were to be examples of holy living&mdash;Heaven&rsquo;s exponents of true religion.<br><br><strong>Look at the phrase in the verse for today in which the Lord says that they were to be &ldquo;above all people . . . of the earth.&rdquo; Considering all that the Word has taught about the virtue of humility and the danger of pride, what do you think that verse means?

Joseph&rsquo;s deathbed words repeated this promise (Gen. 50:24). God informed Abraham, however, that &ldquo;four hundred years&rdquo; would pass before the seed of Abraham would take possession of the land (Gen. 15:13, 16). Fulfillment of the promise began in the days of Moses and Joshua Moses repeated the promise in the divine command: &ldquo; &lsquo; &ldquo;Behold, I have set the land before you; go in and take possession of the land&rdquo; &rsquo; &rdquo; (Deut. 1:8, RSV).<br><br><strong>Read Deuteronomy 28:1, 15.

The other section of the chapter deals with the curses that would befall them if they did not. These curses were &ldquo;largely, though not wholly, brought about by simply giving sin scope to work out its own evil results. . . . &lsquo;He that soweth to [his] flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption&rsquo; (Gal. [6]:8). Like water, which, left to itself, will not cease running till it has found its level; like a clock, which, left to itself, will not cease going till it has run itself completely down; like a tree, which, left to grow, cannot but bring forth its appropriate fruit&mdash;so sin has a level to seek, a course to run, a fruit to mature, and &lsquo;the end of those things is death&rsquo; (Rom. [6:]21).&rdquo;&mdash;The Pulpit Commentary: Deuteronomy, ed., H. D. M. Spence and Joseph S. Exell, (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1985), vol. 3, p. 439.<br><br>Despite all the promises of land, those promises were not uncondi- tional. They came as part of a covenant. Israel had to fulfill her end of the bargain; if not, the promises could be nullified. The Lord made it very clear, more than once, that if they disobeyed, the land would be taken from them. Read Leviticus 26:27&ndash;33. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how the Lord could have been more explicit with His words.<br><br><strong>As Christians, we look forward to receiving and keeping the Promised Lands of heaven and the earth made new. They have been promised to us, just as the earthly Promised Land was to the Hebrews. The difference, however, is that once we get there, there is no chance of our ever losing it (Dan. 7:18). At the same time, there are conditions for getting there. How do you understand what these conditions are, especially in the context of salvation by faith alone?</strong></p>"

The Lord says that He will bring upon them &ldquo;all the words of this covenant.&rdquo; Yet, He is talking about something bad! Though we tend to think of the covenant as offering us only something good, there&rsquo;s the flip side. This principle was seen with Noah. God offered Noah something wonderful&mdash;preservation from destruction&mdash; but Noah had to obey in order to receive the blessings of God&rsquo;s grace. If he did not, the other side of the covenant would follow.<br><br><strong>Compare the above text with Genesis 6:5 regarding the pre-Flood world. What&rsquo;s the parallel? What do these verses say about how important it is for us to control our thoughts?</strong><br><br>Genesis 6:5 5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.<br><br>Unfortunately, for the most part, the history of national Israel was a repeated pattern of apostasy followed by divine judgments, repentance, and a period of obedience. Only briefly, under David and Solomon, did Israel control the full extent of the promised territory.<br><br>Look at these texts from Jeremiah regarding Israel&rsquo;s apostasy. &ldquo;They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man&rsquo;s, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the Lord. . . . Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord&rdquo; (Jer. 3:1, 20).<br><br>This brings up something touched upon earlier: The covenant God wants with us is not merely some cold legal agreement made between businesspeople looking to cut the best deal for themselves. The covenant relationship is a commitment, one as serious and sacred as marriage, which is why the Lord uses the imagery that He does.<br><br>The point is that Israel&rsquo;s apostasy did not have its root in disobedience but in a broken personal relationship with the Lord, a break that resulted in disobedience that finally brought punishment upon them.<br><br><strong>Why is the personal, relational aspect so crucial in the Christian life? Why, if our relationship with God isn&rsquo;t right, are we so prone to fall into sin and disobedience?

Many of the Old Testament prophets speak of this faithful remnant, whom God would gather unto Himself as a lovely bouquet.<br><br>The purpose of God in creating and preserving a faithful remnant was the same as it had been for all of Israel&mdash;to use them as His divinely appointed instruments for declaring &ldquo; &lsquo;my glory among the nations&rsquo; &rdquo; (Isa. 66:19, RSV). By this means, others would join the faithful to &ldquo;worship the King, the Lord of hosts&rdquo; (Zech. 14:16, RSV).<br><br>Thus, no matter how bad the situation became, God always had some faithful people who, despite apostasy within the ranks of God&rsquo;s chosen people, kept their own calling and election sure (2 Pet. 1:10). In short, whatever the failings of the nation as a whole, there were still those who tried to keep, as best they could, their end of the covenant (see, for instance, 1 Kings 19:14&ndash;18). And though, perhaps, they suffered with their nation as a whole (such as when exiled from the land), the final and ultimate covenant promise will be theirs&mdash;that of eternal life.<br><strong><br>Read John 10:27, 28.

So says the apostle, &lsquo;The promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.&rsquo; Romans 4:13. And the Bible plainly teaches that the promises made to Abraham are to be fulfilled through Christ. . . .

He hadn&rsquo;t worked as a physician for two years because of his two-year-old son&rsquo;s illness. He needed a house and a job.<br><br>Hernando moved his family from their hometown in northern Colombia to Medellin, the country&rsquo;s second-largest city, in hopes of finding a hospital to treat Samuel&rsquo;s kidney problems. But after living in the hospital for a year, he needed a house for Samuel; his wife, Erica; and their 11-year-old son, Immer. Nothing seemed affordable near the hospital. He prayed and found a house whose owner rented rooms to students. He asked for a room.<br><br>&ldquo;I only have one empty room, and a student has paid for it,&rdquo; the owner said. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; Hernando said. &ldquo;God brought me here because I need that room.&rdquo; The owner gave him the room rent-free for six months.<br><br>With that kind gesture, Hernando was certain that God was leading him. Immer had lived with relatives in another city for a year, and Hernando wanted to enroll him in a Christian school near the hospital. A hospital receptionist heard about his quest. &ldquo;I know a good Christian school nearby,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My niece studied there. It&rsquo;s Seventh-day Adventist.&rdquo;<br><br>Hernando wasn&rsquo;t familiar with the Adventist Church. But a visit to the school impressed him, and Immer started classes. Shortly into the school year, Immer informed the teacher that his father was a physician. &ldquo;Tell him to give me his r&eacute;sum&eacute; so I can submit it to the Adventist clinic,&rdquo; the teacher said. She knew that the Adventist Medical Center on the campus of Colombia Adventist University was struggling to find a physician.<br><br>Immer told his father, and Hernando gave his r&eacute;sum&eacute; to the teacher. &ldquo;I want to work, but I can&rsquo;t because I need to be with my baby,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; the teacher said. &ldquo;Just show up for the interview.&rdquo;<br><br>When the clinic called him for an interview, Hernando explained his need for a flexible schedule. He was hired on the spot. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll work with your schedule,&rdquo; the director said, adding that he could help with Samuel&rsquo;s paperwork.<br><br>A grateful Hernando joined the clinic&rsquo;s team. He became acquainted with the Adventist faith and accepted an invitation to attend church. His understanding of God&rsquo;s love grew. &ldquo;The Adventists were hospitable, humble, and sincerely interested in helping me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I brought my family to church.&rdquo;<br><br>Hernando and his family were baptized into the Adventist Church. Today, Samuel is a healthy eight-yearold boy, and Hernando works full-time at the Adventist Medical Center, where he has led more than 100 patients and others to Christ through his personal testimony<br><br>Hernando believes that God led him every step of the way. &ldquo;Other hospitals wouldn&rsquo;t work with me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was a miracle that the Adventist clinic hired me.&rdquo;</p>"
