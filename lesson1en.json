If you drive in Ireland along a nar- row country lane lined with hedgerows, you may find the way blocked by a herd of cows ambling home after a crunchy meal. Even if no herdsman is with them, they will go to their owner&rsquo;s barn. They will know where, and to whom, they belong. If a small boy in a store gets separated from his mother and yells, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my mommy!&rdquo; he may not know exactly where he is, or where his mother is, but amid a sea of mothers walking through the store, he will know the one mother who, alone, is his own.<br><br>Sad to say, unlike even those Irish cows (much less the little lost boy), the Judaeans forgot that they belonged to the Lord, their heavenly Lord, and thus lost their true identity as the covenant people. &ldquo;I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master&rsquo;s crib; but Israel does not know, my people do not understand&rdquo; (Isa. 1:2, 3, NRSV).<br><br>This week we&rsquo;ll take a look at God&rsquo;s work to restore His people to Himself.<br><br>* Study this week&rsquo;s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, January 2.</p>"

         "lessonText":"<p>The book of Isaiah briefly introduces itself by identifying the author (&ldquo;son of Amoz&rdquo;), the source of his message (a &ldquo;vision&rdquo;), and his topic (Judah and its capital, Jerusalem, during the reign of four kings). The topic also identifies Isaiah&rsquo;s primary audience as the people of his own country during the time in which he lived. The prophet spoke to them concerning their own condition and destiny.<br><br>By mentioning the kings during whose reigns he was active, Isaiah narrows down the audience and ties the book to the historical, political events of a certain period. This time frame directs us to the accounts of 2 Kings 15&ndash;20 and 2 Chronicles 26&ndash;32.<br><br><strong>Read Isaiah 1:2. What is the essence of the message here? What is the Lord saying? How has this same idea been seen all through sacred history? Could it be said of the Christian church today, as well?

The Lord isn&rsquo;t implying that heaven and earth, themselves, can hear and understand. Instead, He does it for emphasis. When an ancient Near Eastern king, such as a Hittite emperor, made a political treaty with a lesser ruler, he invoked his gods as witnesses to emphasize that any violation of the agreement would surely be noticed and punished. However, when the divine King of kings made a covenant with the Israelites in the days of Moses, He did not refer to other gods as witnesses. As the only true God, He called, instead, for the heavens and earth to fulfill this role (see also Deut. 4:26).<br><br><strong>Read carefully Isaiah 1:1&ndash;9.

By mistreating other mem- bers of the covenant community, they were showing contempt for the Protector of all Israelites. Sins against other people were sins against the Lord.<br><br>Of course, God Himself had instituted the ritual worship system (Leviticus 1&ndash;16) and designated the Jerusalem temple as the appro- priate place for it (1 Kings 8:10, 11). But the rituals were intended to function within the context of the covenant God had made with these people. It was God&rsquo;s covenant with Israel that made it possible for Him to dwell among them at the sanctuary/temple. So, ritu- als and prayers performed there were valid only if they expressed faithfulness to Him and His covenant. People who offered sacrifices without repenting from unjust actions toward other members of the covenant community were performing ritual lies.

This appeal suggests there is hope. After all, why urge a criminal deserving execution to change his ways? How could a prisoner on death row &ldquo;rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow&rdquo; (NRSV)?<br><br>But when God says &ldquo;Come now, let us argue it out&rdquo; (Isa. 1:18, NRSV), we can see the Lord still seeking to reason with His people, still seeking to get them to repent and turn from their evil ways, no matter how degenerate they have become.<br><br>The Lord says to them that &ldquo;Your red sins shall become white.&rdquo; Why are sins red? Because red is the color of the &ldquo;blood&rdquo; (blood guilt) that covers the hands of the people (Isa. 1:15). White, by contrast, is the color of purity, the absence of blood guilt. Here, God is offering to change them. This is the kind of language King David used when he cried out to God for forgiveness for his sin of taking Bathsheba and destroying her husband (read Ps. 51:7, 14).<br><br><strong>In Isaiah 1:18, God&rsquo;s argument is an offer to forgive His people!

They are not to reject His people but to bring them back to Him. His offer of forgiveness is the mighty argument supporting His appeal for the people to purify themselves morally (Isa. 1:16, 17). His forgiveness makes it possible for them to be transformed by His power. Here we see the seeds of the &ldquo;new covenant,&rdquo; prophesied in Jeremiah 31:31&ndash;34, in which forgiveness is the basis of a new-heart relationship with God. We start off &ldquo;in the red,&rdquo; owing a debt we can never repay. From the humble position of acknowledging our need for forgiveness, we are ready to accept everything God has to give.</p>"

By contrast, if they refuse His offer of forgiveness and restoration and rebel against Him, they will be eaten by the sword (Isa. 1:20). The choice is theirs. These verses, then, contain a conditional blessing and curse.<br><br>Isaiah 1 reiterates and applies the words of Moses recorded in Deuteronomy 30:19, 20 at the time when the covenant with the nation of Israel was set up: &ldquo;I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses&rdquo; (NRSV).<br><strong><br>Look at those words from Moses. Notice, there is no middle ground. It is either life or death, blessings or curses. Why do you think there is only one of two choices for us? Why can&rsquo;t there be some sort of compromise?</strong><br><br>These words of Moses summarize the series of warnings, blessings, and curses that conclude the formation of the covenant in Deuteronomy 27&ndash;30 (compare Leviticus 26). Elements of this covenant include (1) the recount- ing of what God had done for them, (2) conditions/stipulations (command- ments) to be observed in order for the covenant to be maintained, (3) refer- ence to witnesses, and (4) blessings and curses to warn people what would happen if they violated the covenant conditions.<br><br>Scholars have found that these elements appear in the same order in political treaties involving non-Israelite peoples, such as the Hittites. So, for establishing God&rsquo;s covenant with the Israelites, He used a form they would understand and would impress upon them as forcefully as possible the nature and consequences of the mutually binding relationship into which they were choosing to enter. The potential benefits of the covenant were staggering, but if Israel broke their agreement, they would be worse off than ever.<br><br><strong>In your own Christian walk, how have you experienced the principle of blessings and curses as seen above?</strong></p>"

         "lessonText":"<p><strong>Read the song in the above verses. What is the meaning of this parable?</strong><br><br>God explains the meaning of the parable only at the end, in Isaiah 5:7. By using a parable, He helps the people to look at themselves objectively in order to admit their true condition. God effectively used this approach with King David (see 2 Sam. 12:1&ndash;13). By calling this a &ldquo;love-song&rdquo; (NRSV), God reveals at the outset His motive toward His people. His relationship with them originates from His character, which is love (1 John 4:8). He expects a response of love in return. But instead of &ldquo;grapes,&rdquo; He gets &ldquo;wild grapes,&rdquo; which means, in the Hebrew, &ldquo;stinking things.&rdquo;<br><br><strong>What does the Lord mean when He says in Isaiah 5:4, &ldquo;What more was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it?&rdquo; (NRSV).</strong></p> <p><strong>Isaiah 5:4</strong></p> <div class=\"poetry\"> <p class=\"line\"><span class=\"text Isa-5-4\"><sup class=\"versenum\"><strong>4</strong>&nbsp;</sup>What more could have been done to My vineyard</span><strong><br></strong><span class=\"text Isa-5-4\">That I have not done in it?</span><br><span class=\"text Isa-5-4\">Why then, when I expected <em>it</em> to bring forth <em>good</em> grapes,</span><br><span class=\"text Isa-5-4\">Did it bring forth wild grapes?</span></p> </div> <p><br>God says in the next verses: &ldquo;And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down. I will make it a waste&rdquo; (Isa. 5:5, 6, NRSV).<br><br>When we sin, God does not immediately cut us off from Himself by removing His protection and destroying us. He patiently gives us an oppor- tunity to receive forgiveness (see 2 Pet. 3:9). He does not cut off anyone who responds to Him. He appeals as long as there is hope for a response. He does not immediately take no for an answer, because He knows we are ignorant and deceived by sin. But if He gets nowhere with us, He ultimately acknowledges our choice and lets us remain the way we have chosen to be (see Rev. 22:11).<br><br>If we persistently reject God&rsquo;s appeals through His Spirit, we can eventually pass the point of no return (Matt. 12:31, 32). Turning away from Christ is dangerous (Heb. 6:4&ndash;6). There is only so much God can do, because He respects our free choice.<br><br><strong>Take the concept found in Isaiah 5:4, about &ldquo;What more could have been done to My vineyard,&rdquo; (NKJV) and look at that in light of the Cross, where God offered Himself as a sacrifice for our sins, paying with His flesh for our violation of His law. What more could have been done for us than what He did there?</strong></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;How does dwell- ing on the Cross give us assurance of salvation and motivate us to repent and change our ways?</strong></p>"

They could not see afar off; for they had forgotten that they had been purged from their old sins. They moved restlessly and uncertainly under darkness, seeking to obliterate from their minds the memory of the freedom, assurance, and happiness of their former estate. They plunged into all kinds of presumptuous, foolhardy madness, placed themselves in opposition to the providences of God, and deepened the guilt that was already upon them. They listened to the charges of Satan against the divine character, and represented God as devoid of mercy and forgiveness.&rdquo;&mdash;The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1137.<br><br><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong><br><br><strong>1</strong>.

Mercifully, He points out their condition, warns them about the destructive consequences of abandoning His protection, and urges them to allow Him to heal and cleanse them.</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>Inside Story:</strong><br><br><strong>Duped in Ukraine By Andrew Mcchesney, Adventist Mission</strong><br><br>A Seventh-day Adventist deacon never expected to be duped by a mother and her teenage son whom he invited into his home after they fled conflict in eastern Ukraine. But he has no regrets. &ldquo;We acted with sincere hearts for God, and we will let God act as the judge between her and us,&rdquo;Valentin Zaitsev said.<br><br>The story began in 2015 when Valentin learned that a first wave of inter- nally displaced people had reached his Black Sea city, Mykolaiv. The plight of the internally displaced people touched his heart. So Valentin, a construction foreman, set out with his wife to a government-run hostel, where they found 50 displaced people living in two buildings, six to eight people per room.<br><br>Valentin introduced himself as a Christian and asked the displaced people what was needed. The immediate reply was diapers and wet wipes. &ldquo;We went to the supermarket and bought both,&rdquo; Valentin said. &ldquo;We then asked what else we could provide, and they asked for underwear, women&rsquo;s hygienic items, and potatoes. The authorities had given them a place to stay but not much else.&rdquo;<br><br>As a friendship grew, Valentin invited his new friends to Bible studies. Eleven agreed, and an Adventist pastor began to study with them every evening. Then violence erupted at the hostel, and a 19-year-old man, Valery, was hospitalized with stab wounds. When Valentin and his wife visited the hospital, the teen&rsquo;s mother, Natasha, pleaded for a new place to stay. Valentin was renting a three-room apartment, and he offered a room to her and her son.<br><br>For a while, everything seemed fine. Natasha even attended the Adventist church. But then Valentin found out that she was not penniless as she claimed and that she was taking advantage of people&rsquo;s kindness to con them out of money. &ldquo;We fed her and her son and paid their cell phone bill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But then we learned that they were not poor. We asked them to move out.&rdquo; Natasha and her son had lived with the family for six months.<br><br>Looking back, Valentin said the experience was a blessing. Natasha proved a big help around the house, cooking, washing, and babysitting his three chil- dren. But the biggest blessing, he said, was the opportunity to love her. &ldquo;We received joy and blessings because we were able to serve someone else,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our family became better. I would not do anything differently.&rdquo; Valentin believes that it is important to help everyone whether or not they accept Jesus.<br><br>&ldquo;Our duty is to live and serve, and the rest is up to God,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We water with goodness, and God collects the harvest.&rdquo;</p>"
