      "lessonText": "<p>Most Bible students know the story of Genesis 1&ndash;3 and its cast of characters: God, Adam, Eve, the angels, the serpent. The setting is a splendid garden in a paradise called &ldquo;Eden.&rdquo; The plotline seems to follow a logical series of events. God creates. God instructs Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve sin. Adam and Eve are banished from Eden. However, a closer look at the first few chapters of Genesis, especially through the lens of education, will uncover insights into the cast, the setting, and the story.</p> <p><br></p> <p>&ldquo;The system of education instituted at the beginning of the world was to be a model for man throughout all aftertime. As an illustration of its principles a model school was established in Eden, the home of our first parents. The Garden of Eden was the schoolroom, nature was the lesson book, the Creator Himself was the instructor, and the parents of the human family were the students.&rdquo;&mdash;Ellen G. White, Education, p. 20.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The Lord was founder, principal, and teacher of this first school. But as we know, Adam and Eve ultimately chose another teacher and learned the wrong lessons. What happened, why, and what can we learn from this early account of education that can help us today?</p>"

When you consider teacher-student dynamics, this is an ideal relationship. God knew Adam&rsquo;s abilities because He had created Adam. He could teach Adam, knowing that Adam could realize his full potential.</p> <p><br></p> <p>God gave the man responsibility, but He also wanted happiness for him, as well. And perhaps part of the means of giving him happiness was giving him responsibilities. After all, who doesn&rsquo;t get satisfaction&mdash;happiness, even&mdash;from being given responsibilities and then faithfully fulfilling them? God knew the heart of Adam and what he would need to thrive; so, He gave Adam the task of taking care of the garden. &ldquo;Then the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to tend and keep it&rdquo; (Gen. 2:15, NKJV). It&rsquo;s hard for us to imagine, knowing only a world of sin and death as we do, what the work must have entailed and the lessons that, no doubt, Adam learned as he worked and kept their garden home.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In Genesis 2:19&ndash;23, God created animal companions for Adam, and He also created Eve as Adam&rsquo;s wife. God knew that Adam needed the companionship and help of a peer; so, He created woman.</p> <p><br></p> <p>God also knew that man needed to be in close relationship with Him; so, He created an intimate space in Eden within the confines of the garden. All of this attests to God&rsquo;s purposefulness in Creation and His love for humanity. Again, from the great distance between us and Eden, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine what it must have been like&mdash;though it is fun to try to imagine, isn&rsquo;t it?</p> <p><br></p> <p><strong>Though we are far removed from Eden, we can still learn lessons from nature.

      "lessonText": "<p>One of the great joys for many teachers is assembling their classrooms: hanging bulletin boards, organizing supplies, and arranging the rooms in the most desirable way. When we look at God&rsquo;s vision for the classroom that was the Garden of Eden, we see the care He took in preparing a learning environment for Adam and Eve. He desired beauty to surround them. We can imagine that every flower, bird, animal, and tree offered an opportunity for Adam and Eve to learn more about their world and about their Creator.</p> <p>Yet, there is an abrupt shift from Genesis 2 to Genesis 3. We have taken inventory of all the good that God created with divine intention. But in Genesis 3:1 we also awaken to God&rsquo;s provision for free will. The presence of the serpent as &ldquo;more subtil than any beast of the field&rdquo; is a departure from the language heretofore used. Such words as &ldquo;very good&rdquo; and &ldquo;not ashamed&rdquo; and &ldquo;pleasant&rdquo; are adjectives used to describe God&rsquo;s creation in the prior chapters. Now, however, with the serpent, there is a change of tone. The word &ldquo;subtil&rdquo; also is translated in some versions as &ldquo;cunning.&rdquo; Suddenly a negative element is introduced in what, so far, has been only perfection.</p> <p>In contrast, Genesis presents God as the opposite of &ldquo;cunning.&rdquo; God is emphatically clear about His expectations of the pair in the garden. We know from God&rsquo;s command in Genesis 2:16, 17 that He has established one key rule that they must obey, and that was not to eat from the forbidden tree.</p> <p>Whatever else we can take from this story, one thing stands out: Adam and Eve were created as free moral beings, beings who were able to choose between obedience and disobedience. Hence, right from the start, even in an unfallen world, we can see the reality of human free will.</p> <p><strong>In Genesis 3:1&ndash;6, examine the descriptions the serpent used and that Eve then repeated. What do you notice about the information that the serpent offers Eve? What do you notice about how Eve then regards the tree of knowledge of good and evil?</strong></p> <p><strong> <meta charset=\"utf-8\">Genesis 3:1&ndash;6</strong></p> <p> <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> </p> <p class=\"chapter-1\" style='box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2.4rem; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, \"Noto Sans\", sans-serif, Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;'><span class=\"text Gen-3-1\"><strong>1</strong> Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the <span class=\"small-caps divine-name\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Lord</span> God had made.

One can hardly exaggerate the consequences of her actions.</p> <p>Thus, when Eve encountered the serpent, she repeated (but not exactly) to the serpent what God had said regarding the trees in the garden (Gen. 3:2, 3). Of course, this message wasn&rsquo;t news to the serpent. The serpent was familiar with the command and was therefore well-prepared to twist it, thus preying upon Eve&rsquo;s innocence.</p> <p><strong>Examine Genesis 3:4&ndash;6. Besides directly denying exactly what God had said, what else did the serpent say that, obviously, succeeded with Eve? What principles did he take advantage of?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Genesis 3:4-6</strong></p> <p>4 Then the serpent said to the woman, &ldquo;You will not surely die.&nbsp;</p> <p>5 For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree desirable to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.</p> <p>When the serpent told her that part of the message was incorrect, Eve could have gone to confer with God. This is the beauty of Eden&rsquo;s education: the access the students had to their Mighty Teacher was surely beyond anything we can now fathom on earth. However, instead of fleeing, instead of seeking divine aid, Eve accepts the serpent&rsquo;s message. Her acceptance of the serpent&rsquo;s revision to the message requires some doubt on Eve&rsquo;s part about God and what He had told them.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Adam wanders into a difficult situation himself. &ldquo;Adam understood that his companion had transgressed the command of God, disregarded the only prohibition laid upon them as a test of their fidelity and love. There was a terrible struggle in his mind. He mourned that he had permitted Eve to wander from his side. But now the deed was done; he must be separated from her whose society had been his joy. How could he have it thus?&rdquo;&mdash;Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 56. Unfortunately, though knowing right from wrong, he also chose wrongly.</p> <p><strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>Think of the deceptive irony here: the serpent said that if they ate of the tree, they would &ldquo;be like God&rdquo; (Gen. 3:5, NKJV). But didn&rsquo;t Genesis 1:27 say that they were already like God? What can this teach us about how easily we can be deceived and why faith and obedience are our only protection, even when we have been given the best of educations, as had Adam and Eve?</strong></p>"

Think about what Adam and Eve lost because of their sin. When we understand their fall, we can better understand the purpose of education for us in the present age. In spite of their banishment, life in an imperfect world ushered in a new purpose for education.&nbsp;</p> <p>If education before the Fall was God&rsquo;s way of acquainting Adam and Eve with Him, His character, His goodness, and His love, then after their banishment the work of education must be to help reacquaint humanity with those things, as well as re-create the image of God in us. In spite of their physical removal from God&rsquo;s presence, God&rsquo;s children can still come to know Him, His goodness, and His love. Through prayer, service, and studying His Word, we can draw close to our God as did Adam and Eve in Eden.&nbsp;</p> <p>The good news is that because of Jesus and the plan of redemption, all is not lost.

What does Peter write that we must do in order to seek restoration of God&rsquo;s image in our lives? </strong></p> <p><strong>2 Peter 1:3&ndash;11 </strong></p> <p>3 as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue,&nbsp;</p> <p>4 by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.&nbsp;</p> <p>5 But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge,&nbsp;</p> <p>6 to knowledge self-control, to self-control perseverance, to perseverance godliness,&nbsp;</p> <p>7 to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love.&nbsp;</p> <p>8 For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p> <p>9 For he who lacks these things is shortsighted, even to blindness, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins.&nbsp;</p> <p>10 Therefore, brethren, be even more diligent to make your call and election sure, for if you do these things you will never stumble;&nbsp;</p> <p>11 for so an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Through Jesus, we have been given &ldquo;all things that pertain to life and godliness&rdquo; (NKJV). What a promise! What might some of those things be? Well, Peter gives us a list: faith, virtue, knowledge, selfcontrol, perseverance, and so on. Notice, too, that knowledge is one of the things Peter mentions. This idea, of course, leads to the notion of education. True education will lead to true knowledge, the knowledge of Christ, and thus not only will we become more like Him, but we also may stand to share our knowledge of Him with others.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Think for a moment about the fact that the forbidden tree was the tree of &ldquo;the knowledge of good and evil&rdquo; (Gen. 2:17, emphasis supplied). What should that tell us about why not all knowledge is good? How do we know the difference between good and bad knowledge?</strong></p>"

      "lessonText": "<p>Some people are considered &ldquo;natural students&rdquo; in the classroom. They barely need to study to make excellent grades. They absorb material easily. Their knowledge seems to &ldquo;stick.&rdquo; Second Peter 1 and 2, however, make it evident that our education in Christ is an equal opportunity experience for those who will dedicate themselves to Him.&nbsp;</p> <p>The encouraging words of 2 Peter 1 contrast with the sobering warning in 2 Peter 2.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Read 2 Peter 2:1&ndash;17. What powerful and condemning words is Peter saying here? At the same time, amid this sharp warning and condemnation, what great hope is promised to us?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>2 Peter 2:1&ndash;17 </strong></p> <p>1 But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.&nbsp;</p> <p>2 And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed.&nbsp;</p> <p>3 By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber.&nbsp;</p> <p>4 For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment;&nbsp;</p> <p>5 and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;&nbsp;</p> <p>6 and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, making them an example to those who afterward would live ungodly;&nbsp;</p> <p>7 and delivered righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked&nbsp;</p> <p>8 (for that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds)&mdash;&nbsp;</p> <p>9 then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment,&nbsp;</p> <p>10 and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. They are presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries,&nbsp;</p> <p>11 whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.&nbsp;</p> <p>12 But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in their own corruption,&nbsp;</p> <p>13 and will receive the wages of unrighteousness, as those who count it pleasure to carouse in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, carousing in their own deceptions while they feast with you,&nbsp;</p> <p>14 having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls. They have a heart trained in covetous practices, and are accursed children.&nbsp;</p> <p>15 They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;&nbsp;</p> <p>16 but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a man&rsquo;s voice restrained the madness of the prophet.&nbsp;</p> <p>17 These are wells without water, clouds carried by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p> <p>Notice what Peter writes in verse 10 about those who despise authority. What a sharp rebuke for what is a reality in our day, as well. We as a church body must work on the assumption of certain levels of authority (see Heb. 13:7, 17, 24), and we are called to submit to and obey them, at least to the degree that they are being faithful to the Lord themselves.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, amid this harsh condemnation, Peter offers a counterpoint. He says that although God is mighty to cast out those who chose deception, &ldquo;the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations&rdquo; (2 Pet. 2:9, NKJV). Is it possible that part of our education in Christianity is not only avoiding temptation but also learning the many ways that God can and does deliver us from it, as well as help guard us against those, Peter warns, who will &ldquo;secretly bring in destructive heresies&rdquo; (2 Pet. 2:1, NKJV)? And, since the despising of authority is so condemned, shouldn&rsquo;t our Christian education also consist of learning the right way to understand, submit, and obey &ldquo;those who rule over you&rdquo; (Heb. 13:7, NKJV)?&nbsp;</p> <p>Though one could not say that Adam and Eve despised authority, in the end they chose to disobey that authority. And what made their transgression so bad was that they did it in response to a blatant contradiction of what that authority, God Himself, had told them, and who had done so for their own good, as well.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dwell more on this question of authority, not just in the church or in the family, but in life in general. Why is authority, both the proper exercise of authority and the proper submission to it, so important? Bring your answers to class on Sabbath.</p>"

      "lessonText": "<p><strong>Further Thought:</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;The holy pair were not only children under the fatherly care of God but students receiving instruction from the all-wise Creator. They were visited by angels, and were granted communion with their Maker, with no obscuring veil between. They were full of the vigor imparted by the tree of life, and their intellectual power was but little less than that of the angels. The mysteries of the visible universe&mdash;&lsquo;the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge&rsquo; (Job 37:16)&mdash;afforded them an exhaustless source of instruction and delight. The laws and operations of nature, which have engaged men&rsquo;s study for six thousand years, were opened to their minds by the infinite Framer and Upholder of all. They held converse with leaf and flower and tree, gathering from each the secrets of its life. With every living creature, from the mighty leviathan that playeth among the waters to the insect mote that floats in the sunbeam, Adam was familiar. He had given to each its name, and he was acquainted with the nature and haBits of all. God&rsquo;s glory in the heavens, the innumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions, &lsquo;the balancings of the clouds,&rsquo; the mysteries of light and sound, of day and night&mdash;all were open to the study of our first parents. On every leaf of the forest or stone of the mountains, in every shining star, in earth and air and sky, God&rsquo;s name was written. The order and harmony of creation spoke to them of infinite wisdom and power. They were ever discovering some attraction that filled their hearts with deeper love and called forth fresh expressions of gratitude.&rdquo;&mdash;Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 50, 51.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Discussion Questions: </strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> If God originally intended for school/work to be an opportunity for humans to encounter Him and His creation, are we still in keeping with God&rsquo;s intention in our work today? How can we become better acquainted with God through our work (paid, educational, voluntary, ministerial, etc.)?&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2</strong> When we consider the craftiness of Satan in the Garden of Eden, it is easy to become frustrated with our own human weakness. Adam and Eve knew God was close, and yet they accepted the serpent&rsquo;s half-truth. How can we, who are removed from such close physical proximity to God, still find power from Him to help us to overcome temptation?&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Discuss the question of authority and why it is so important to obey that authority. What happens when the lines of authority become blurred? How can authority be abused, and how do we respond when it is?</p> INSIDE STORY <p><strong>INSIDE STORY&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Helping a Distressed Priest</strong></p> <p>By Gabriel Golea&nbsp;</p> <p>The Romanian priest came to me with a problem. &ldquo;Can you convince the commission members that I have a good job and a good level of education so I can start my doctoral studies?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;</p> <p>The priest had enrolled to study theology at the University of Strasbourg in France, but the doctoral commission had decided that he first needed to repeat a year of undergraduate studies. I was a second-year doctoral student, and he and I struck up a friendship when we realized that we both were from Romania.&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;Do you believe in God?&rdquo; I asked the priest, smiling. He was shocked. &ldquo;Of course, I do!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you believe in the power of prayer?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I believe that God can do miracles,&rdquo; the priest said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about a ritual or some other religious ceremony,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;God can answer our prayers if we pray directly to Him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>Several days later, I invited the priest to pray with me. &ldquo;Before I ask the professors, we should make this a matter of prayer,&rdquo; I said. The priest agreed.&nbsp;</p> <p>I decided not to try to convince the professors to change the rules for the priest but instead to show them that Romania&rsquo;s education system met French standards. I met with each of the seven professors who sat on the commission. Each promised to review the matter at the next commission meeting. The professors ended up testing the priest&rsquo;s knowledge in a special interview and accepting him into the doctoral program. We thanked God for the miracle!&nbsp;</p> <p>Our friendship flourished over the next two years. The priest often visited my home to talk, eat, and worship with my family. But during his third year, the priest announced that he would leave the program. &ldquo;I have a new job,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have been appointed as Romania&rsquo;s secretary of state for religious affairs.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> <p>He had become the Romanian government&rsquo;s top religion official. You never know the far-reaching influence of your words and actions. Upon hearing that a priest had taken office, some Adventists in Romania feared restrictions on religious freedom, especially against members of smaller religious denominations like the Seventh-day Adventist Church. But no crackdown materialized. In fact, the priest turned government minister was exceedingly fair and objective with people of all faiths.&nbsp;</p> <p>After he settled into his job, I jokingly asked to visit his office for a photo. &ldquo;I want to show my children that I know someone famous,&rdquo; I said. He laughed. &ldquo;Come anytime you want,&rdquo; he said. We remain friends to this day.</p>"
