      "lessonText": "<p>Many people seem desperate to find a little peace and quiet. They are willing to pay for it too. In many big cities there are internet-free rooms, which can be rented by the hour. The rules are strict&mdash;no noise, no visitors. People are willing to pay to be able to sit quietly and just think or nap. There are sleep pods that can be rented in airports, and noise-reducing earphones are popular items. There are even canvas hoods, or collapsible privacy shields that you can buy to pull over your head and torso for a quick workplace break.</p> <p>True rest also has a cost. While the spin doctors of the self-help media would like to make us believe that we can determine our own destiny and that rest is just a matter of choice and planning, yet, at least when we consider this honestly, we realize our inability to bring true rest to our hearts. In the fourth-century, Augustine put it succinctly in his famous <em>Confessions </em>(Book 1) as he considered God&rsquo;s grace: &ldquo;You have made us for yourself, and our hearts are restless, until they can find rest in you.&rdquo;</p> <p>This week we look briefly into the life of the man after God&rsquo;s own heart to find out how he discovered the true cost of God&rsquo;s rest.</p>"

      "lessonText": "<p>On a balmy spring evening, restless King David paced the roof of his palace. He should have been with his army on the other side of the Jordan. He should have been leading God&rsquo;s people to defeat the Ammonites and finally bring peace to the kingdom.</p> <p><strong>Not being where he should have been opened the door to temptation for David. Read the story in 2 Samuel 11:1&ndash;5. What happened, and what great sin did David commit? </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2 Samuel 11:1&ndash;5</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> It happened in the spring of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the people of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Then it happened one evening that David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king&rsquo;s house. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to behold.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> So David sent and inquired about the woman. And someone said, &ldquo;Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?&rdquo;</p> <p>4 Then David sent messengers, and took her; and she came to him, and he lay with her, for she was cleansed from her impurity; and she returned to her house.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> And the woman conceived; so she sent and told David, and said, &ldquo;I am with child.&rdquo;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>David saw a &ldquo;very beautiful woman&rdquo; taking a bath on her roof. His sinful impulses got the better of him that evening, and he slept with Bathsheba, the wife of a trusted army officer. Like all ancient kings, David had absolute power. As king, he didn&rsquo;t have to follow the rules that governed everyone else. And yet, the painful story of David&rsquo;s family following this story-changing moment reminds us of the fact that, even as the king, he was not above God&rsquo;s law.</p> <p>Indeed, the law is there as a protection, a safeguard, and when even the king stepped outside it, he faced terrible consequences. As soon as David transgressed the limits of God&rsquo;s law, he began to feel its effects on all aspects of his life. David thought that his passionate fling had gone unnoticed; yet, Bathsheba was now pregnant and her husband far away.</p> <p><strong>Read 2 Samuel 11:6&ndash;27. How did David try to cover up his sin? </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2 Samuel 11:6&ndash;27</strong></p> <p><strong>6</strong> Then David sent to Joab, saying, &ldquo;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&rdquo; And Joab sent Uriah to David.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> When Uriah had come to him, David asked how Joab was doing, and how the people were doing, and how the war prospered.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> And David said to Uriah, &ldquo;Go down to your house and wash your feet.&rdquo; So Uriah departed from the king&rsquo;s house, and a gift of food from the king followed him.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> But Uriah slept at the door of the king&rsquo;s house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.</p> <p><strong>10</strong> So when they told David, saying, &ldquo;Uriah did not go down to his house,&rdquo; David said to Uriah, &ldquo;Did you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>11</strong> And Uriah said to David, &ldquo;The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields. Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>12</strong> Then David said to Uriah, &ldquo;Wait here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.&rdquo; So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.</p> <p><strong>13</strong> Now when David called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. And at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.</p> <p><strong>14</strong> In the morning it happened that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</p> <p><strong>15</strong> And he wrote in the letter, saying, &ldquo;Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck down and die.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>16</strong> So it was, while Joab besieged the city, that he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew there were valiant men.</p> <p><strong>17</strong> Then the men of the city came out and fought with Joab. And some of the people of the servants of David fell; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</p> <p><strong>18</strong> Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war,</p> <p><strong>19</strong> and charged the messenger, saying, &ldquo;When you have finished telling the matters of the war to the king,</p> <p><strong>20</strong> if it happens that the king&rsquo;s wrath rises, and he says to you: &lsquo;Why did you approach so near to the city when you fought? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?</p> <p><strong>21</strong> Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Was it not a woman who cast a piece of a millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall?&rsquo;&mdash;then you shall say, &lsquo;Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p> <p><strong>22</strong> So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Joab had sent by him.</p> <p><strong>23</strong> And the messenger said to David, &ldquo;Surely the men prevailed against us and came out to us in the field; then we drove them back as far as the entrance of the gate.</p> <p><strong>24</strong> The archers shot from the wall at your servants; and some of the king&rsquo;s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>25</strong> Then David said to the messenger, &ldquo;Thus you shall say to Joab: &lsquo;Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against the city, and overthrow it.&rsquo; So encourage him.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>26</strong> When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.</p> <p><strong>27</strong> And when her mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Even David&rsquo;s most intricate schemes to get Uriah home to his wife, Bathsheba, failed. Uriah was a man of stellar reputation who responded to David&rsquo;s subtle hints: &ldquo; &lsquo;The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields. Shall I then go to my house to eat and drink, and to lie with my wife?&rsquo; &rdquo; <em>(2 Sam. 11:11, NKJV)</em>. Eventually a desperate David reverted to &ldquo;remote control&rdquo; assassination to cover his sin.</p> <p><strong>It is hard to believe that David, to whom God had given so much, could have stooped so low. No matter who we are, what warning should we all take from this story?</strong></p>"

      "lessonText": "<p>In the midst of one of the darkest times of David&rsquo;s life there was good news: <em>God sent His prophet</em>. Nathan and David knew each other well. Earlier, Nathan had counseled David on his plans to build a temple <em>(2 Samuel 7)</em>. Now, though, the prophet came with a different task to perform for his king.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think Nathan chooses to tell a story rather than naming and shaming David immediately? Read 2 Samuel 12:1&ndash;14. </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2 Samuel 12:1&ndash;14</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> Then the Lord sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him: &ldquo;There were two men in one city, one rich and the other poor.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> The rich man had exceedingly many flocks and herds.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> But the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished; and it grew up together with him and with his children. It ate of his own food and drank from his own cup and lay in his bosom; and it was like a daughter to him.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> And a traveler came to the rich man, who refused to take from his own flock and from his own herd to prepare one for the wayfaring man who had come to him; but he took the poor man&rsquo;s lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>5</strong> So David&rsquo;s anger was greatly aroused against the man, and he said to Nathan, &ldquo;As the Lord lives, the man who has done this shall surely die!</p> <p><strong>6</strong> And he shall restore fourfold for the lamb, because he did this thing and because he had no pity.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Then Nathan said to David, &ldquo;You are the man! Thus says the Lord God of Israel: &lsquo;I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> I gave you your master&rsquo;s house and your master&rsquo;s wives into your keeping, and gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if that had been too little, I also would have given you much more!</p> <p><strong>9</strong> Why have you despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in His sight? You have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword; you have taken his wife to be your wife, and have killed him with the sword of the people of Ammon.</p> <p><strong>10</strong> Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.&rsquo;</p> <p><strong>11</strong> Thus says the Lord: &lsquo;Behold, I will raise up adversity against you from your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.</p> <p><strong>12</strong> For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, before the sun.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p> <p><strong>13</strong> So David said to Nathan, &ldquo;I have sinned against the Lord.&rdquo;</p> <p>And Nathan said to David, &ldquo;The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die.</p> <p><strong>14</strong> However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die.&rdquo;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Nathan knew what to say, and he said it in a way that David could under&shy;stand. He told a story that David, the former shepherd, could relate to. He knew David&rsquo;s highly developed sense of justice and integrity. Thus, in a sense, one could say that Nathan set a trap and that David walked right into it.</p> <p>When David unwittingly pronounced his own death sentence, Nathan told him, &ldquo; &lsquo;You are the man&rsquo; &rdquo; <em>(2 Sam. 12:7, NKJV)</em>. There are different ways of saying &ldquo;You are the man.&rdquo; One can shout it, one can accuse and stick a finger right into the other person&rsquo;s face, or one can express con&shy;cern and care. Nathan&rsquo;s words must have been laced with grace. At that moment, David must have felt the pain that God must feel when one of His sons or daughters knowingly steps outside of His will. Something clicked in David&rsquo;s mind. Something tore in his heart.</p> <p><strong>Why does David respond with: &ldquo;I have sinned against the L</strong><strong>ord</strong><strong>&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;I have sinned against Bathsheba&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am a murderer&rdquo; <em>(2 Sam. 12:13; see also Ps. 51:4)</em>? </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>2 Sam. 12:13</em></strong></p> <p><strong>13</strong> So David said to Nathan, &ldquo;I have sinned against the Lord.&rdquo;</p> <p>And Nathan said to David, &ldquo;The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>Ps. 51:4</em></strong></p> <p><strong>4</strong> Against You, You only, have I sinned,<br />And done this evil in Your sight&mdash;<br />That You may be found just when You speak,<br />And blameless when You judge.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>David recognized that sin, which makes our heart restless, is primarily an affront against God, the Creator and Redeemer. We hurt ourselves; we affect others. We bring disgrace to our families or churches. Yet, ultimately, we hurt God and drive another nail into the rough beam pointing heavenward on Golgotha.</p> <p>&ldquo;The prophet&rsquo;s rebuke touched the heart of David; conscience was aroused; his guilt appeared in all its enormity. His soul was bowed in penitence before God. With trembling lips he said, &lsquo;I have sinned against the Lord.&rsquo; All wrong done to others reaches back from the injured one to God. David had committed a grievous sin, toward both Uriah and Bathsheba, and he keenly felt this. But infinitely greater was his sin against God.&rdquo;&mdash;Ellen G. White, <em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em>, p. 722.</p>"

      "lessonText": "<p>After David had unwittingly pronounced judgment on himself <em>(2 Sam. 12:5, 6)</em>, Nathan confronted him with the enormity of his sin. David&rsquo;s heart was broken, and he confessed his sin. Immediately Nathan assured him that &ldquo; &lsquo;The Lord also has put away your sin&rsquo; &rdquo; <em>(2 Sam. 12:13, NKJV) </em>and that he was forgiven. There was no waiting period for God&rsquo;s forgiveness. David didn&rsquo;t have to prove that he was really sincere before forgiveness was extended.</p> <p>However, Nathan, who already had predicted the consequences of David&rsquo;s sin in 2 Samuel 12:10&ndash;12, went on to state that the child to be born would die.</p> <p><strong>What does it mean that God had taken away David&rsquo;s sin? Did He just wipe the slate clean? Does everyone just simply forget about it? Read 2 Samuel 12:10&ndash;23 as you contemplate these questions. </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>2 Samuel 12:10&ndash;23</strong></p> <p><strong>10</strong> Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me, and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.&rsquo;</p> <p><strong>11</strong> Thus says the Lord: &lsquo;Behold, I will raise up adversity against you from your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.</p> <p><strong>12</strong> For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, before the sun.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p> <p><strong>13</strong> So David said to Nathan, &ldquo;I have sinned against the Lord.&rdquo;</p> <p>And Nathan said to David, &ldquo;The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die.</p> <p><strong>14</strong> However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>15</strong> Then Nathan departed to his house.</p> <p>And the Lord struck the child that Uriah&rsquo;s wife bore to David, and it became ill.</p> <p><strong>16</strong> David therefore pleaded with God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground.</p> <p><strong>17</strong> So the elders of his house arose and went to him, to raise him up from the ground. But he would not, nor did he eat food with them.</p> <p><strong>18</strong> Then on the seventh day it came to pass that the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead. For they said, &ldquo;Indeed, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not heed our voice. How can we tell him that the child is dead? He may do some harm!&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>19</strong> When David saw that his servants were whispering, David perceived that the child was dead. Therefore David said to his servants, &ldquo;Is the child dead?&rdquo;</p> <p>And they said, &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>20</strong> So David arose from the ground, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the Lord and worshiped. Then he went to his own house; and when he requested, they set food before him, and he ate.</p> <p><strong>21</strong> Then his servants said to him, &ldquo;What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child died, you arose and ate food.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>22</strong> And he said, &ldquo;While the child was alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, &lsquo;Who can tell whether the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?&rsquo;</p> <p><strong>23</strong> But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.&rdquo;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>David also must have wondered about these questions as he saw his world crumbling&mdash;the baby dead, his family in disarray (the stories of Amnon and Absalom are two good examples of real-life family troubles), and his future uncertain. And yet, despite the consequences of his sin, which had affected innocent people such as Uriah and the newborn baby, David also began to understand that God&rsquo;s grace would cover this and that someday all the consequences of sin would be done away with. In the meantime, he could find rest for his troubled conscience in God&rsquo;s grace.</p> <p><strong>What does David feel he really needs? What does he yearn for? Read Psalm 51:1&ndash;6. </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Psalm 51:1&ndash;6</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Have mercy upon me, O God,<br />According to Your lovingkindness;<br />According to the multitude of Your tender mercies,<br />Blot out my transgressions.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,<br />And cleanse me from my sin.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> For I acknowledge my transgressions,<br />And my sin is always before me.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Against You, You only, have I sinned,<br />And done this evil in Your sight&mdash;<br />That You may be found just when You speak,<br />And blameless when You judge.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,<br />And in sin my mother conceived me.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts,<br />And in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>With Psalm 51, David went public as he opened his heart and con&shy;fessed his sins. David&rsquo;s cry for mercy appealed to God&rsquo;s unfailing love and His great compassion. He yearned for renewal.</p> <p>When we consider the cost of rest in Jesus, we need first to recognize that we need outside help; we are sinners and need a Savior; we recognize our sins and cry out to the only One who can wash us, cleanse us, and renew us. When we do this, we can take courage: here is an adulterer, a manipulator, a murderer, and someone who violated at least five of the Ten Commandments who called for help&mdash;and claimed the promise of God&rsquo;s forgiveness.</p> <p><strong>If God forgave David for what he did, what hope is there, then, for you?</strong></p>"

As he referred to the ritual acts of cleansing described in the Law of Moses (<em>Lev. 14:4)</em>, he recognized the power of a sacrifice&mdash;<em>the </em>Sacrifice&mdash; who would come in the future to take away the sins of the world.</p> <p>David also went on to ask for &ldquo;joy&rdquo; and &ldquo;gladness.&rdquo; In the face of the enormity of his sin, wasn&rsquo;t this a little audacious?</p> <p>Perhaps it may be helpful to listen to this paraphrase: &ldquo;Tell me I am forgiven so that I may enter the sanctuary again where I can hear the joy and gladness of those worshiping you.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>When Adam and Eve sinned, they hid from God&rsquo;s presence <em>(Gen. 3:8)</em>.

He realized that without the Holy Spirit he was powerless. He knew that as easily as he slipped into sin with Bathsheba, he could slip into sin again. His self-confidence was shattered.</p> <p>David understood that future victories would not come from him; they would come only from God as he depended totally on God.</p> <p>The victorious Christian life is not all about us. It is all about Jesus. We yearn for <em>His </em>presence; we crave <em>His </em>Spirit; we want <em>His </em>joy of salvation. We recognize our need for renewal and restoration. We need His rest&mdash;a divine act of re-creation. Creation rest is not far from for&shy;giveness. &ldquo;Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me&rdquo; <em>(Ps. 51:10, NKJV) </em>uses Creation terminology.

God&rsquo;s precious forgiveness glues our brokenness together, and the visible breaks can draw attention to His grace. We can become God&rsquo;s loudspeakers. &ldquo;My tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness&rdquo; <em>(Ps. 51:14, NKJV)</em>. We don&rsquo;t attempt to self-repair or auto-improve (even incrementally). Our broken spirits, our contrite hearts, are enough praise for God&mdash;and they are beams of light that the world can see surrounding us. Our experience of being forgiven attracts others who are searching for forgiveness.</p> <p><strong>What</strong> <strong>relationship is there between Psalm 51 and 1 John 1:9? </strong></p> <p><strong>Psalm 51</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> Have mercy upon me, O God,<br />According to Your lovingkindness;<br />According to the multitude of Your tender mercies,<br />Blot out my transgressions.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,<br />And cleanse me from my sin.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> For I acknowledge my transgressions,<br />And my sin is always before me.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Against You, You only, have I sinned,<br />And done this evil in Your sight&mdash;<br />That You may be found just when You speak,<br />And blameless when You judge.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,<br />And in sin my mother conceived me.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts,<br />And in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;<br />Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Make me hear joy and gladness,<br />That the bones You have broken may rejoice.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> Hide Your face from my sins,<br />And blot out all my iniquities.</p> <p><strong>10</strong> Create in me a clean heart, O God,<br />And renew a steadfast spirit within me.</p> <p><strong>11</strong> Do not cast me away from Your presence,<br />And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.</p> <p><strong>12</strong> Restore to me the joy of Your salvation,<br />And uphold me by Your generous Spirit.</p> <p><strong>13</strong> Then I will teach transgressors Your ways,<br />And sinners shall be converted to You.</p> <p><strong>14</strong> Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God,<br />The God of my salvation,<br />And my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.</p> <p><strong>15</strong> O Lord, open my lips,<br />And my mouth shall show forth Your praise.</p> <p><strong>16</strong> For You do not desire sacrifice, or else I would give it;<br />You do not delight in burnt offering.</p> <p><strong>17</strong> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,<br />A broken and a contrite heart&mdash;<br />These, O God, You will not despise.</p> <p><strong>18</strong> Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion;<br />Build the walls of Jerusalem.</p> <p><strong>19</strong> Then You shall be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,<br />With burnt offering and whole burnt offering;<br />Then they shall offer bulls on Your altar.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>1 John 1:9</strong></p> <p><strong>9</strong> If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First John 1:9 is a short summary of Psalm 51. As David knows that &ldquo;a broken and a contrite heart&mdash;these, O God, You will not despise&rdquo; (<em>Ps. 51:17, NKJV)</em>, John assures us that &ldquo;if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrigh&shy;teousness&rdquo; <em>(1 John 1:9, NKJV)</em>. We can take God at His word.</p> <p>Again, David could not repair the tremendous damage that he had done through his acts and example to his family. He suffered the conse&shy;quences of his decisions and actions. And yet, David knew that he had been forgiven. He knew that he needed to trust by faith that one day the true Lamb of God would come and stand in his place.</p> <p><strong>How can you learn right now to apply the promises of 1 John 1:9 to your own life? </strong><strong>How should you feel after you do so and know that the promise is for you too?</strong></p>"

No desire to escape the judgments threat&shy;ened, inspired his prayer. . . . He saw the defilement of his soul; he loathed his sin. It was not for pardon only that he prayed, but for purity of heart. . . . In the promises of God to repentant sinners he saw the evidence of his pardon and acceptance. . . . &lsquo;The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.&rsquo; Psalm 51:16, 17.</p> <p>&ldquo;Though David had fallen, the Lord lifted him up. . . .</p> <p>&ldquo;David humbled himself and confessed his sin, while Saul despised reproof and hardened his heart in impenitence.</p> <p>&ldquo;This passage in David&rsquo;s history is . . . one of the most forcible illustrations given us of the struggles and temptations of humanity, and of genuine repentance. . . . Through all the ages . . . thousands of the children of God, who have been betrayed into sin, . . . have remembered . . . David&rsquo;s sincere repentance and confession . . . and they also have taken courage to repent and try again to walk in the way of God&rsquo;s com&shy;mandments.</p> <p>&ldquo;Whoever . . . will humble the soul with confession and repentance, as did David, may be sure that there is hope for him. . . . The Lord will never cast away one truly repentant soul.&rdquo;&mdash;Ellen G. White, <em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em>, pp. 725, 726.</p> <p><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p> <p><strong>1&nbsp;How can we find the balance between recognizing our inherent sinfulness and need for forgiveness and, at the same time, living like the forgiven sons and daughters of the King of the universe that we are? </strong></p> <p><strong>2 Why is all sin, ultimately, sin against God? What does it mean to sin against God? </strong></p> <p><strong>3&nbsp;What can we say to someone, not a believer, who struggles with the suffering of innocent people, such as Uriah or the newborn son of David and Bathsheba? How do we explain the love and justice of God in such a situation? How does the perspective of the great controversy offer a helpful outlook? </strong></p> <p><strong>4 Why would God devote two full chapters of the Bible to the sordid story of David and Bathsheba? What purpose does the recounting of this story serve? </strong></p> <p><strong>5&nbsp;Dwell on the idea that sin separates us from God as expressed in Psalm 51:11, 12. </strong><strong>What has been your own experience with how this happens? How would you explain to someone what this separation feels like and why it&rsquo;s so uncomfortable? Why is the promise of grace the only remedy?</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>INSIDE STORY</strong></p> <p><strong>Thanking God for Life</strong></p> <p><strong><em>By </em>Andrew McChesney</strong></p> <p>Fifteen-year-old Giselle didn&rsquo;t feel well when she woke up one morning. She prayed before getting out of bed as she always did.</p> <p>&ldquo;Dear God, thank You for everything You have done for me, especially that I am still alive,&rdquo; she prayed.</p> <p>She thanks God for life every day. She and her family immigrated as refu&shy;gees to the United States from Rwanda when she was 12. She faced a difficult life in her African homeland, where her parents struggled to find work and the family had little to eat. She often went hungry.</p> <p>After praying, Giselle slid out of bed in the bedroom on the second floor of the family&rsquo;s small home in the U.S. state of Georgia and carefully walked down the stairs. She felt so weak.</p> <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel well,&rdquo; she told her mother.</p> <p>Mother was talking on the cell phone, but she interrupted her conversation.</p> <p>&ldquo;Go back upstairs and go back to bed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll feel better.&rdquo;</p> <p>Giselle turned around to climb up the stairs and collapsed. She heard Mother call out her name as she fell down the last three stairs and crumpled onto the hard floor below.</p> <p>&ldquo;Giselle!&rdquo; Mother cried. &ldquo;Are you OK?&rdquo;</p> <p>Giselle was unable to reply. She couldn&rsquo;t breathe, so she couldn&rsquo;t speak.</p> <p>Mother hung up the phone and ran over.</p> <p>&ldquo;Giselle! Giselle!&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>Giselle still couldn&rsquo;t answer.</p> <p>Mother touched her forehead to see if she had a fever. No fever.</p> <p>Mother called Giselle&rsquo;s 19-year-old sister to bring an electric fan to provide some air.</p> <p>The cool air felt good on Giselle&rsquo;s face. She began to breathe.</p> <p>&ldquo;Are you OK?&rdquo; Mother asked.</p> <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine now,&rdquo; she said.</p> <p>Mother wanted to take Giselle to the hospital, but the girl insisted that she was fine. Mother gave her some water to drink. Giselle later learned from the physician that she had collapsed because she wasn&rsquo;t eating properly.</p> <p>The night after her fall, Giselle prayed before going to sleep. She prays every night before bedtime.</p> <p>&ldquo;Dear God,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thank You for this day, and thank You for everything that You have done for us, especially for keeping me alive.&rdquo;</p> <p><em>This quarter&rsquo;s Thirteenth Sabbath Offering will help refugee children like Giselle obtain scholarships to study at Seventh-day Adventist schools in the North American Division. Giselle received financial assistance from a 2011 Thirteenth Sabbath Offering to study at an Adventist school in the U.S. state of Georgia. Through the influence of the school, she gave her heart to Jesus in baptism.</em></p>"
